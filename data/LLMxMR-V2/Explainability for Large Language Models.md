# 0. A Survey on Explainability for Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have heralded a transformative era in Artificial Intelligence, demonstrating unprecedented capabilities across diverse domains such as text generation, complex mathematical computations, and multi-language processing [12,33]. Their advanced proficiency has led to widespread applications, revolutionizing fields from medical research and clinical diagnosis to academic peer review, coding, and time series analysis [19,20]. Major technology companies have integrated LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 into commercial products, underscoring their significant practical impact and pervasive influence [26,30].

Despite these remarkable advancements, a fundamental challenge persists: LLMs are largely "black-box" systems, characterized by opaque internal mechanisms and complex architectures that render their decision-making processes inscrutable [10,27]. This opacity, stemming from massive parameter counts and extensive training data, obscures the underlying computational graphs and reasoning chains, even in open-source models [12,27]. This inherent lack of transparency introduces significant risks and ethical concerns, particularly in high-stakes application areas such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where issues like model hallucinations, generation of harmful content, and perpetuation of algorithmic biases can have severe consequences [28,34].

Consequently, Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a crucial field dedicated to bridging the gap between complex LLM-based systems and human comprehension. 

**Core Objectives of Explainable AI (XAI) for LLMs**

The objectives of XAI for LLMs are multifaceted: to enhance **understanding** of LLM behavior, limitations, and societal impact by clarifying their mechanisms [10,22]; to facilitate **debugging and improvement** by providing insights for identifying biases, risks, and performance enhancements, leading to more reliable and safe systems [22,30]; to foster **trust** among users and stakeholders by offering clear, human-understandable explanations of decision mechanisms [10,22]; and to ensure **responsible and ethical AI** by promoting accountability, facilitating ethical governance, and complying with regulations [10,22]. The urgency of XAI is further underscored by the growing use of LLMs in human-like evaluative tasks, where their propensity for "hallucination" necessitates rigorous error-checking and transparent judgments to maintain validity and trust [9,21]. This emphasizes that transparency is paramount for responsible LLM development and deployment, requiring a human-centered approach to XAI that adapts to varying stakeholder needs [2,6].

Building upon existing efforts to systematically understand LLM explainability [1,27], this survey aims to provide a comprehensive and uniquely structured analysis. While prior works have offered diverse categorization schemes, such as those based on LLM training paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning versus prompting, local versus global explanations) [1,10] or architectural types (e.g., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder models) [27], our work integrates these perspectives to construct a holistic framework.

A distinguishing feature of this survey is its dual perspective: we examine LLMs not only as complex systems requiring explainability (subjects of XAI) but also as powerful tools capable of generating explanations and performing automated evaluations for other AI systems (agents of XAI) [10,27].

The unique contributions of this survey include an extensive foundational background on LLMs [33,34], a structured and integrated XAI taxonomy that combines architectural and training paradigm classifications [1,27], a critical analysis of current challenges such as technical hurdles in decomposing LLM layers and inferring neuron functionality [18], and actionable future research directions emphasizing systematic frameworks and interdisciplinary collaborations [11,32]. By adopting this approach, this survey provides a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, diverse applications, and future challenges, offering readers a holistic and forward-looking perspective on explainability for Large Language Models.
### 1.1 Motivation and Significance of LLMs and Explainability
Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a transformative era for Artificial Intelligence, exhibiting unprecedented capabilities across a multitude of domains and tasks. Their advanced proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text has enabled their pervasive influence in areas such as text generation, mathematical calculations, and multi-language processing [12,33]. Specific applications highlight this remarkable versatility: LLMs are revolutionizing medical research and practice by accelerating diagnosis and outcome prediction through automated machine learning, democratizing complex data analyses for non-technical experts [19,20]. For instance, ChatGPT ADA can autonomously develop high-performing ML models for tasks like cancer development prediction [19]. Similarly, LLMs are poised to re-engineer academic peer review processes, promising faster, more consistent, and insightful evaluations, while streamlining literature analysis and data interpretation in scientific and social sciences [9,34]. Beyond these, LLMs excel in coding tasks—generating, explaining, debugging, and optimizing code—thereby accelerating development, fostering creativity, and enhancing inclusivity in fields like ecology and evolution [28]. The cross-task transferability and zero-shot/few-shot learning capabilities observed in time series analysis further underscore their generalizability and potential for unification across diverse challenges [35]. Major technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu are actively deploying LLMs like BERT, GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 in commercial products to enhance functionalities, for example, improving search relevance in New Bing with GPT-3.5 [26,30].

Despite these impressive advancements, a fundamental challenge persists: LLMs are predominantly "black-box" systems with opaque internal mechanisms and complex architectures, making their decision-making processes inherently inscrutable [3,10,16,27,30]. This opacity stems from their massive parameter counts and extensive training data, which obscure the underlying computational graphs and reasoning chains [12,15,27,30,32]. Unlike traditional interpretable models, understanding LLM behavior often requires analyzing input-output relationships rather than explicit internal workings, even for open-source models like LLaMA-2 [10]. This inherent lack of transparency introduces significant risks and ethical concerns, particularly in sensitive, high-stakes application areas such as healthcare, finance, legal sectors, and autonomous systems [15,17,19,20,27,31,32].

The critical need for Explainable AI (XAI) in the LLM era arises from these challenges. The black-box nature of LLMs can lead to various issues including model hallucinations—producing plausible but factually incorrect or baseless text [4,28,34], the generation of harmful or inappropriate content [18,27,30], and the perpetuation of algorithmic biases derived from training data, such as gender bias in translations [27,31]. Without transparency, these systems face deployment risks like user distrust, governance challenges, and ambiguity in accountability, as exemplified by cases such as autonomous wheelchairs lacking safety overrides [17].

Consequently, XAI emerges as a crucial bridge between complex LLM-based systems and human comprehension, pursuing several explicit goals:
1.  **Understanding**: XAI aims to clarify LLM behavior, limitations, and societal impact by elucidating the mechanisms behind their predictions and revealing their internal computational processes [10,12,13,22,30]. This fosters human understanding of LLM functions and potential defects without requiring technical expertise [30].
2.  **Debugging and Improvement**: XAI serves as a vital diagnostic and debugging tool for researchers and developers. It provides insights to identify unexpected biases, risks, and areas for performance enhancement, aids in tracking functional changes, facilitates model comparison, and ultimately leads to the development of more reliable, ethical, and safe systems [13,22,25,27,30,32]. For instance, understanding internal jailbreak mechanisms through XAI can inform robust defense development and targeted fine-tuning for safety alignment [18].
3.  **Building Trust**: By offering clear, human-understandable explanations of LLM decision mechanisms, XAI fosters appropriate trust among end-users and stakeholders. This is crucial for overcoming the inherent distrust caused by black-box systems and ensuring confidence in AI-driven decisions, particularly in high-stakes fields [10,22,24,27,30,31].
4.  **Ensuring Responsible and Ethical AI**: XAI is indispensable for promoting responsible development and deployment of LLMs, ensuring accountability, facilitating ethical governance, and complying with regulations like GDPR [10,11,22,24,27,30,31]. It addresses critical concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for improper or unethical use [28,34].

The growing urgency and importance of XAI research in the LLM era are undeniable, essential for responsible development and deployment [2]. The rapid emergence of powerful LLMs presents both immense opportunities and significant societal risks, highlighting that responsible development is at a critical juncture and transparency, often overlooked, is paramount [2]. Traditional XAI, focused primarily on algorithmic transparency, is increasingly deemed insufficient for the LLM era, necessitating a human-centered approach that considers who is opening the black box and for what purpose [6]. This perspective underscores that transparency is fundamentally about supporting appropriate human understanding, which varies across stakeholders and contexts [2].

Furthermore, the rationale for XAI extends to scenarios where LLMs perform human-like tasks, such as evaluation. LLMs are being explored as alternatives to human evaluators for assessing text quality, addressing issues like irreproducibility and inconsistency in human judgment [21]. In critical tasks like re-engineering peer review, LLMs promise to enhance speed and consistency [9]. However, their inherent propensity to "hallucinate" necessitates rigorous error-checking and human verification, emphasizing that LLM judgments and explanations in such evaluative roles must be transparent and reliable to ensure trust and validity [9,21]. This dual nature of LLMs—their immense capabilities and their inherent opacity—underscores the indispensable role of Explainable AI in fostering trust, ensuring safety, and driving responsible innovation.
### 1.2 Scope and Structure of the Survey

**Prior XAI Categorization Schemes for LLMs**

The burgeoning field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally driven by a common objective: to foster a systematic understanding of these complex models [1,27]. This endeavor seeks to clarify the "black box" nature of LLMs, addressing both the inherent challenges and opportunities in deciphering their intricate decision-making processes [10]. The ultimate goal is to bridge the profound complexity of LLMs with enhanced user trust, thereby promoting transparency and accountability in their development and application [31]. This pursuit aligns with a broader academic push to critically assess current practices and identify research gaps in LLM explainability, charting a course for future advancements [24].

Existing literature offers diverse categorization schemes for XAI techniques in LLMs, reflecting varied analytical perspectives. A prominent approach classifies explainability methods based on the underlying LLM training paradigms. For instance, several surveys differentiate between traditional fine-tuning models and more recent prompting-based large models, further segmenting explanations into local (for individual predictions) and global (for overall model knowledge) approaches within each paradigm [1,10,13,25,26,30]. This paradigm-centric view is effective in contextualizing explanation strategies relative to how LLMs are developed and deployed.

In contrast, other works adopt an architectural perspective, proposing taxonomies rooted in the Transformer architecture variants of LLMs. Notably, [27] introduces a classification system based on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models, analyzing XAI techniques and use cases specific to each architectural type. This architectural lens provides valuable insights into how inherent model structures might influence the applicability and efficacy of different explanation methods. Beyond these primary classifications, some surveys employ systematic mapping studies to derive novel classification frameworks for LLM explainability [24], while others categorize XAI methodologies more generally into model-specific, model-agnostic, and hybrid approaches, applicable across various AI systems [31]. Furthermore, frameworks such as TAXAL extend beyond mere classification by proposing a triadic fusion of cognitive, functional, and causal dimensions of explainability, aiming for human-centered explanations in agentic LLMs, thus highlighting a movement towards more integrated and purposeful explanation frameworks [15].

Building upon these foundational insights, our survey aims to provide a comprehensive and uniquely structured analysis of XAI for LLMs. We integrate the strengths of both training paradigm-based and architectural-based taxonomies to construct a holistic framework, ensuring a multi-faceted understanding of LLM explainability. While existing surveys primarily focus on LLMs as subjects of explanation, this work uniquely expands its scope to encompass LLMs not only as complex systems requiring explainability but also as powerful tools capable of generating explanations and performing automated evaluations [1,10,27]. For instance, empirical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of LLMs in serving as evaluators for text quality in NLP tasks, aligning their assessments with human expert evaluations [21]. Moreover, LLMs have been leveraged to provide interpretability for other AI models, as seen in their use for SHAP analysis to quantify feature contributions in clinical ML models [19]. This dual perspective—LLMs as *subjects* and *agents* of explainability—is a key differentiating factor of our survey.

Specifically, the unique contributions and value of this survey are articulated as follows:
1.  **Extensive Foundational LLM Background**: We establish a robust understanding of LLM fundamentals, drawing from general LLM surveys [33,34] to provide readers with the necessary context before delving into explainability.
2.  **Structured and Integrated XAI Taxonomy**: Our survey synthesizes the architectural classifications, such as those differentiating encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models [27], with the training paradigm-based categorizations, including fine-tuning versus prompting-based methods [1,10], to offer a unified and comprehensive XAI taxonomy for LLMs. This integration allows for a more granular and comparative analysis of existing methods.
3.  **Critical Analysis of Current Challenges**: We conduct an in-depth critical appraisal of the nuanced differences in XAI methods and research results. This includes highlighting specific technical hurdles, such as decomposing the complex contributions of LLM layers and inferring the functionality of critical neurons, especially in contexts like jailbreak analysis [18]. We also discuss broader challenges, including the inherent trade-off between interpretability and accuracy, scalability issues for large models, and prevailing ethical dilemmas in XAI for LLMs [2,31].
4.  **Actionable Future Research Directions**: Moving beyond mere identification, we propose concrete and actionable future research directions, building on calls for systematic frameworks and interdisciplinary collaborations to advance XAI in LLMs [11,24,32].
5.  **Explainability in LLM Applications**: Our survey extends beyond the explainability of LLMs themselves to explore how LLMs facilitate explainability in other AI systems and novel applications, such as automated evaluation [21] and clinical machine learning model interpretability [19].

This structured approach ensures a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, diverse applications, and future challenges, providing readers with a holistic and forward-looking perspective on explainability for Large Language Models.
## 2. Large Language Models: Foundations and Evolution
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a pivotal advancement in artificial intelligence, fundamentally characterized as neural language models scaled to unprecedented dimensions [27,33]. At their core, LLMs are built upon the Transformer architecture, which leverages self-attention mechanisms to effectively encode intricate contextual relationships between linguistic tokens, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies in textual data [23,27,33]. The "large" in LLM signifies their vast scale, encompassing neural networks with billions of parameters trained on immense quantities of unlabeled text, often reaching hundreds of billions of words [22,33,34]. This monumental scale and diverse training data confer upon them powerful reasoning, generation, and generalization capabilities across a wide spectrum of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks [10,24]. These capabilities manifest as emergent abilities, such as in-context learning and multi-task generalization, which are not explicitly programmed but arise from their sheer scale and training depth [27,32,33].

The architectural cornerstone for most contemporary LLMs is the Transformer, moving beyond the limitations of earlier recurrent neural networks by exclusively employing self-attention for unparalleled parallelizability [10,23,33]. This architecture, initially featuring an encoder-decoder structure, has evolved into specialized encoder-only (e.g., BERT) or decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA) designs, each suited for different paradigms [27,30]. Within a Transformer, the processing pipeline involves tokenization—the dissection of raw text into linguistic units—followed by the transformation into dense, continuous numerical representations known as word embeddings [34]. These embeddings are crucial for capturing semantic and syntactic associations, with modern LLMs favoring contextualized embeddings that adapt their representation based on surrounding text, significantly enhancing their ability to handle polysemy and nuanced meanings [16,33]. The internal architecture further distributes parameters between Multi-Head Attention (MHA), responsible for correlation and global information integration, and the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), considered the primary locus for knowledge storage, with lower layers handling superficial patterns and higher layers encoding abstract concepts [22].

The development of LLMs is guided by distinct training paradigms. The traditional fine-tuning paradigm involves pre-training a foundational model on vast corpora to acquire general language representations, then fine-tuning it on smaller, task-specific datasets [10,30]. In contrast, the more recent prompting-based paradigm leverages natural language instructions or examples—prompts—to elicit desired behaviors from base models (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA-2) without extensive additional training data, facilitating zero-shot or few-shot learning [10,30,33]. This paradigm further develops into assistant models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) through alignment techniques like instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), aiming to ensure helpful, harmless, and human-aligned outputs [10,30,33].

A foundational principle governing this continuous evolution is the "scaling law," which posits a direct relationship between model size, data quantity, and resultant capabilities, driving the relentless pursuit of larger and more sophisticated models [27,33]. However, this immense scale and the intricate interplay of attention mechanisms and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) within the multi-layer Transformer architecture contribute significantly to their inherent opacity, making them predominantly perceived as "black-box" systems [1,15,22,24,27,31,32]. This opacity is exacerbated by challenges such as output uncertainty, potential for hallucination, and the perpetuation of biases embedded in training data [9,22,31]. 

![Lifecycle Stages of Foundation Models (LLMs)](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/ZvgSJF86ecfjzFR7jz3bt_Lifecycle%20Stages%20of%20Foundation%20Models%20%28LLMs%29.png)

The lifecycle of these foundation models, from data collection and pre-processing to training, evaluation, and deployment, also presents significant system-level challenges due to escalating computational and storage demands, further obscuring their internal logic [23]. Consequently, bridging the gap between LLM behavior and human understanding through advanced explainability methods becomes a critical necessity, directly addressing the complexities arising from their foundational architectures, training methodologies, and internal representations.
### 2.1 Definition and Characteristics
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant class of modern artificial intelligence systems, fundamentally characterized as neural language models scaled to an unprecedented extent [27,33]. These models are typically built upon the Transformer architecture, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to encode contextual relationships between tokens [27]. Their "large" designation stems from their architecture involving neural networks with billions, and sometimes hundreds of billions, of parameters, and their training on massive quantities of unlabeled text, often comprising hundreds of billions of words [10,15,16,22,31,32,33,34]. This immense scale and diverse training data are crucial for their powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications [10,24].

The generalization abilities of LLMs are extensive, allowing them to excel in a wide range of tasks and reducing the need for handcrafted features [24,33]. They are adept at tasks such as classifying and generating text, including computer code, responding to questions in a conversational style, machine translation, dialogue generation, and code synthesis [27,28]. Prominent examples like GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA-2, Claude, BERT, and Gemini demonstrate superior performance in complex cognitive tasks such as answering multiple-choice questions, story generation, and common-sense reasoning [10,26,30,34]. Furthermore, they exhibit "emergent abilities," such as multi-step arithmetic, word unscrambling, identifying offensive content, in-context learning, and multi-task generalization, which were not explicitly programmed but arise from their scale and training [27,32,33]. This also includes strong zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities, enabling meaningful responses from instructional textual inputs without explicit fine-tuning [18,21,35]. Specific applications extend to clinical research data analysis with tools like ChatGPT ADA [19], specialized medical question-answering [20], scientific literature analysis [9], and acting as evaluators by processing instructions and providing graded responses [21].

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are predominantly perceived as "black-box" systems [1,2,10,11,12,14,15,16,20,22,24,25,26,27,30,31,32]. This opacity stems from their intricate internal workings, high complexity, and deeply layered representations, making their decision-making processes difficult to trace, understand, and interpret [16,22,24,27]. Challenges include "output uncertainty," where the same input may yield different outputs [22], a degree of randomness in responses affecting reproducibility [28], the potential for hallucination [4,9], and the perpetuation of biases present in their massive training datasets [22,31]. This inherent opacity sets the stage for the critical need for explainability in LLMs, as articulated in the overarching discussion on XAI and LLM interpretability [24].

A foundational principle governing LLM development is the "scaling law," which posits a direct link between model size, the quantity of training data, and the resulting capabilities [33]. This principle explains how increasing parameters and training data diversity leads to enhanced performance and the emergence of novel behaviors and reasoning abilities, underpinning the continuous pursuit of larger and more sophisticated models in the field [23,27,33]. The substantial computational resources required for both training and deployment of these increasingly large models, exemplified by examples like GPT-J (6 billion parameters) and GPT-3 (175 billion parameters), further underscores the engineering challenges associated with their development and application [16,23]. This scaling phenomenon, while driving capability, simultaneously intensifies the "black-box" problem by augmenting internal complexity, making the task of understanding and explaining LLMs more challenging [15,31].
### 2.2 Core Architectures and System Aspects
Large Language Models (LLMs) fundamentally rely on deep neural networks, with the Transformer architecture serving as the cornerstone for most modern iterations [10,23,27,28]. While early LLMs frequently utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for sequence processing, these architectures faced significant limitations including slow training, sequential processing hindering parallelization, and the vanishing gradient problem, which rendered them inefficient for large-scale Natural Language Processing (NLP) [33]. The introduction of the attention mechanism, particularly self-attention, revolutionized this landscape by enabling models to capture long-range dependencies and correlate different parts of a sequence simultaneously, significantly expanding the information propagation window [23,33].

The Transformer model, introduced in 2018, exclusively employs the self-attention mechanism, abandoning recurrent structures entirely [33,34]. This non-recurrent design allows for unparalleled parallelizability, drastically reducing training times for LLMs on massive text corpora [33]. The original Transformer architecture featured an encoder-decoder structure [33]. The encoder consists of multiple encoding layers, each comprising a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network (FFN), responsible for processing input and generating contextual encodings. The decoder, similarly structured with self-attention and an FFN, additionally includes an attention mechanism over the encoder's outputs to generate the final sequence [33]. In the context of contemporary LLMs, this foundational Transformer architecture underpins models like GPT, LLaMA, and Pengcheng Cloud Brain [23]. 

**Core LLM Architectural Types**

| Architecture Type      | Description                                                               | Common Use Cases                       | Examples                                   |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Encoder-only**         | Processes input bidirectionally to generate contextual encodings.         | Classification, Sequence Labeling      | BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa            |
| **Decoder-only**         | Generates output autoregressively based on preceding tokens.              | Text Generation, Few-shot Learning     | GPT-3, LLaMA, Falcon, OPT                  |
| **Encoder-Decoder**      | Combines both, processing input with encoder and generating output with decoder. | Machine Translation, Summarization     | Original Transformer, T5, ByT5             |

Modern LLMs often specialize, leveraging either encoder-only designs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, prominent in traditional fine-tuning paradigms) or decoder-only designs (e.g., GPT-3, OPT, LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2, Falcon, commonly used in prompting paradigms) [27,30]. Models like LLaMA-2, for instance, can scale up to 70 billion parameters, indicative of the immense complexity inherent in these architectures [30].

The processing pipeline within a Transformer typically involves tokenization, where text is parsed into subword units, followed by embedding, where each token is assigned a fixed vector learned during pre-training [34]. These embeddings then pass through a series of 10 to 100 Transformer layers. Each layer integrates feed-forward networks, layer normalizations, and self-attention networks. The self-attention mechanism generates "value," "query," and "key" vectors for each token, ultimately producing a "contextualized" representation [34]. Due to the inherent lack of positional encoding in the original Transformer, various methods such as absolute, relative, or rotary position embeddings are integrated to imbue the model with sequential information [34].

Further decomposing the Transformer, its parameters are broadly distributed between the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) component and the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) structure. The MHA component accounts for approximately one-third of the total parameters and is primarily responsible for calculating correlation strengths, integrating global information, and establishing connections between tokens [22]. In contrast, the FFN structure, comprising the remaining two-thirds of parameters, is considered the primary locus for knowledge storage, effectively acting as "key-value memories" [22]. The FFN mechanism can be represented by the formula:
$$ \text{FFN}(X) = W_{\text{down}}(\sigma(W_{\text{gate}}(X) \cdot W_{\text{up}}(X))) $$
where $W_{\text{gate}}$, $W_{\text{up}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{\text{ffn}}}$, $W_{\text{down}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{FFN}} \times d}$, $\sigma$ denotes a nonlinear activation function, and $d_{\text{FFN}}$ is the dimension of the FFN [18]. Within this structure, each neuron in the key layer stores a pattern, and an input matching this pattern generates a large response that propagates through the neuron's value weight vector to the FFN's second layer [22]. Research suggests that lower FFN layers typically respond to superficial patterns (e.g., lexical, syntactic knowledge), while middle and higher layers encode more abstract semantic and factual conceptual knowledge [22]. The intricate interplay of these attention mechanisms and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) within the multi-layer Transformer architecture significantly contributes to their complexity and opacity [12,32].

The lifecycle of foundation models, which includes LLMs, encompasses several critical stages [23]:
1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: This initial phase involves cleaning, standardizing, and augmenting vast datasets to ensure high quality and relevance, which is crucial for the model to learn representative features and mitigate noise [23].
2.  **Model Training**: During this stage, the model's parameters are adjusted using backpropagation, a process that demands immense computational resources to optimize the model's fit to the training data [23].
3.  **Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: Post-training, the model's performance is rigorously assessed using test data. Iterative adjustments and fine-tuning are then applied to enhance its generalization capabilities and ensure stable predictive performance on unseen data [23].
4.  **Model Deployment and Serving**: The final stage involves deploying the model for practical applications. This phase focuses on efficient integration into existing systems and performance optimization through techniques such as model quantization and hardware acceleration to minimize latency and improve response times [23].

However, the increasing parameter scale of LLMs introduces significant system-level challenges, particularly concerning their explainability [15,31]. In the training phase, this scale necessitates immense demands on computation and storage, pushing the limits of hardware resources and computational efficiency [23]. Similarly, the serving phase faces escalating workloads, which can lead to increased latency, performance degradation, and resource bottlenecks [23]. These "billions of parameters trained in opaque corpora" contribute to the inherent inscrutability of LLMs' internal logic, making it exceedingly difficult to expose their internal mechanisms or trace specific decision paths [15]. For instance, while specialized LLMs like DocOA are developed based on foundational models such as `GPT-4-1106-preview` for specific applications like osteoarthritis management, the underlying architectural details or system-level deployment challenges often remain underexplored in application-focused literature [20]. This complexity underscores the critical need for advanced explainability methods to bridge the gap between model behavior and human understanding [15,31].
### 2.3 LLM Training Paradigms
The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to distinct training paradigms that dictate their capabilities and adaptation to diverse tasks. Understanding these paradigms is fundamental for comprehending the underlying mechanisms of LLMs and, consequently, for developing effective explainability techniques [1,10,13,26]. 

**LLM Training Paradigms**

Broadly, LLM training can be categorized into two primary approaches: the traditional fine-tuning paradigm and the more recent prompting-based paradigm [10,13,30].

The **traditional fine-tuning paradigm** originated from the transfer learning principle, where a foundational model is first pre-trained on a vast, unlabeled text corpus to acquire general language representations [10,13,22,30]. This pre-training phase, often leveraging unsupervised learning methods, enables the model to capture semantic and syntactic information within the language [30,34]. Subsequently, the pre-trained model undergoes fine-tuning on smaller, domain-specific labeled datasets to adapt it for specific downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis or named-entity recognition [16,33,34]. This typically involves either training the entire neural network or a subset of its layers, often by adding new weights and fully connected layers above the final encoder layer to align with the target task's output structure [13,30,33]. Examples of models that primarily adhere to this paradigm include BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa [10,30]. Explainability research within this paradigm focuses on elucidating how self-supervised pre-training fosters basic language comprehension and how the subsequent fine-tuning effectively equips models to solve specific tasks [25,30].

In contrast, the **prompting-based paradigm** emerged as LLMs scaled in size and capability, addressing some limitations of traditional fine-tuning, particularly the models' inherent difficulty in fully understanding natural language instructions and their propensity for biased or toxic outputs [10,13,33]. This paradigm leverages prompts—natural language instructions or examples—to elicit desired behaviors from a pre-trained base model, facilitating zero-shot or few-shot learning without extensive additional training data [10,22,30,33]. The prompting-based paradigm is often delineated into two developmental stages:

1.  **Base Models**: These are typically large language models, such as GPT-3, OPT, LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 (which can have up to 70 billion parameters), and Falcon. They demonstrate impressive emergent capabilities, including few-shot learning, by processing examples provided directly within the prompt, a technique known as in-context learning [30,33]. Explainability efforts for base models aim to understand how they harness their vast pre-trained knowledge to respond effectively to prompts [30].
2.  **Assistant Models**: These models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA-2-Chat, Alpaca, and Vicuna, are developed by further refining base models. This refinement process, often termed "alignment," is crucial for ensuring that model outputs are helpful, harmless, and adhere to human instructions and preferences [10,13,30]. Key techniques involved are instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [10,21,30,33]. RLHF specifically involves supervised fine-tuning on human-generated prompt-response pairs, followed by learning a reward function from human preferences, which then optimizes the model's policy using reinforcement learning [21,30,33,34]. While effective, RLHF faces challenges such as the scalability and cost of human feedback, and the inherent variability of individual human preferences [33]. Additionally, techniques like multi-task mixed fine-tuning, as seen in models like T0 and FLAN, aim to improve zero-shot performance [21]. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a form of in-context learning, guides models to generate reasoning steps before a final answer, often improving performance on complex tasks [33]. However, it is noteworthy that some studies, such as one testing zero-shot CoT for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in domain-specific medical applications, found no significant performance improvements compared to direct input-output techniques [20], highlighting that the efficacy of prompting strategies can be context-dependent. Assistant models also employ safety fine-tuning to train on refusal examples and build conceptual safety mechanisms against harmful content generation, though these can be challenged by "jailbreak prompts" [18]. Explainability for assistant models focuses on understanding how they learn complex, open-ended interactive behaviors and align with human expectations [30].

While traditional fine-tuning involves explicit parameter updates for task adaptation, the prompting-based paradigm primarily relies on in-context learning, where the model's parameters remain largely unchanged during inference for specific tasks, though continuous learning or fine-tuning based on user interactions can occur for models like ChatGPT ADA [19,33]. The choice between these paradigms, or their combination, depends on factors such as data availability, computational resources, and the desired level of task-specific adaptation versus generalizability. For instance, techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance prompting-based methods by assimilating external knowledge bases, offering a cost-effective alternative to training new models from scratch for domain-specific applications [20]. The distinct nature of these paradigms necessitates different approaches to explainability, a topic that is further explored in subsequent sections.
### 2.4 Linguistic Units and Word Embeddings
The fundamental capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and understand human language relies heavily on their internal representations of linguistic units and their corresponding word embeddings. These foundational components dictate how textual input is tokenized into discrete units and subsequently transformed into continuous vector spaces, capturing intricate semantic and syntactic relationships. The choice of these representations significantly impacts both model performance and the interpretability of LLM outputs [30,34].

**Linguistic Units (Tokenization Techniques)**


**Common Tokenization Techniques for LLMs**

| Technique          | Description                                                              | Example ("Hello, world!")           | Advantages                                   |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Character-level** | Each character is an individual token.                                   | 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', ... | Handles OOV words, good for morphology       |
| **Word-level**     | Divides text into whole words and punctuation.                           | "Hello", ",", "world", "!"          | Intuitive, good for semantic interpretation  |
| **Subword-level**  | Segments words into smaller, frequently occurring subword units.         | "un", "happi", "ness" (for "unhappiness") | Manages OOV terms, morphological variations  |
| **Phrase-level**   | Treats sequences of words with semantic weight as single tokens.         | "New York City"                     | Captures multi-word expressions' meaning   |

Tokenization is the initial process of dissecting raw text into a sequence of discrete linguistic units, known as tokens. The granularity and methodology of tokenization are critical, as they determine the basic elements an LLM operates on, directly influencing its ability to handle vocabulary, morphology, and context [34]. Different approaches to tokenization offer distinct advantages:
*   **Character-level tokenization** treats each character as an individual token, such as segmenting "Hello, world!" into 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!' [34]. This method is particularly useful for languages without clear word boundaries, for tasks requiring fine-grained understanding, or for managing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by decomposing them into known characters. For instance, models like mT5 utilize SentencePiece for character-level segmentation, while ByT5 processes text at the UTF-8 byte level [34].
*   **Word-level tokenization** divides text into whole words or punctuation marks, a common approach for straightforward semantic interpretation [34]. For example, "Hello, world!" becomes "Hello", ",", "world", "!". While intuitive, this method can struggle with OOV words and complex morphological structures. However, for interpretability purposes, ngrams constructed using a word-level tokenizer, such as spaCy, are often preferred as input features for explainability methods [16].
*   **Subword-level tokenization** strikes a balance between character and word-level approaches by segmenting words into smaller, frequently occurring subword units. Techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or Unigram Language Model (ULM) build vocabularies of these subword units, allowing models to process new or complex words by composing them from known subwords (e.g., "unhappiness" might become "un", "happi", "ness") [34]. This approach effectively manages OOV terms and morphological variations, making it a prevalent choice in modern Transformer-based LLMs, where "subword text inputs" are common for adaptations of explainability methods like TransSHAP [30] and for LLM-specific tokenizers like BERT's word-piece tokenizer [16].
*   **Phrase-level tokenization** considers sequences of words or multi-word expressions as single tokens, advantageous when these phrases carry significant semantic or contextual weight, such as "New York City" [34].

**Word Embeddings**
Following tokenization, linguistic units are typically transformed into dense, continuous numerical representations known as word embeddings. These real-valued vectors capture semantic and syntactic associations from their co-occurrence patterns in vast text corpora, such that words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in the vector space [33,34]. The evolution of word embeddings has progressed from static, context-independent representations to dynamic, context-aware ones.

**Static Word Embeddings:** Early embedding models generated a single, fixed vector for each word, irrespective of its context:
*   **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)** is a count-based method that extracts and depicts word usage by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to a term-by-sentence matrix \(A_{t\times s}\) [34]. This decomposition, expressed as $A_{t\times s} = U_{t\times c} \Sigma _{c\times c} V^T_{c\times s}$, where U is a $t \times c$ column-orthogonal matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $c \times c$ diagonal matrix of singular values, and $V^T$ is a $c \times s$ orthogonal matrix, identifies underlying semantic relationships based on global co-occurrence statistics [34].
*   **Word2Vec**, developed by Google in 2013, represents a significant shift towards predictive models [33]. It uses a shallow neural network to learn word associations through either the Skip-Gram model (predicting surrounding words from a target word) or Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) (predicting the target word from its context) [34]. Word2Vec embeddings are renowned for exhibiting algebraic properties, such as $V(\text{queen}) \approx V(\text{king}) - V(\text{man}) + V(\text{woman})$, demonstrating their capacity to capture analogies. CBOW is generally more efficient, while Skip-Gram excels at representing rare words [34].
*   **Global Vectors (GloVe)** combines aspects of both count-based and predictive methods. It's an unsupervised algorithm that generates word embeddings by leveraging global co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, using a log-bilinear model to define an objective function: $$J = \sum _{i,j} f(X_{ij}) \left(\mathbf{w}_i^T \tilde{\mathbf{w}}_j + b_i + \tilde{b}_j - \log X_{ij}\right)^2$$ Here, $f(X_{ij}) = \min \left( 1, \left( \frac{X_{ij}}{x_{\max }}\right) ^\alpha \right)$ is a weighting function, $X_{ij}$ is the co-occurrence count, and $\alpha$ controls importance [34]. GloVe embeddings, often trained on massive datasets like Common Crawl (e.g., 840 billion tokens, 2.2 million vocabulary, 300-dimensional vectors), serve as robust baselines for many NLP tasks [16].
*   **FastText**, an advancement over Word2Vec, enhances OOV handling and morphological awareness by representing words as composites of character n-grams. A word's embedding is calculated by averaging the embeddings of its constituent character n-grams, offering improved generalizability for rare or unknown words [34].

**Contextualized Word Embeddings:** A pivotal development in NLP introduced embeddings that adapt their representation based on the surrounding context, enabling models to capture polysemy (multiple meanings for a single word) [33].
*   **Contextualized Word Embeddings (CoVe)**, for example, utilizes a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) encoder to produce hidden states that capture contextual details for each word. The forward pass computes $h_t = \text{LSTM\_forward}(e_t, h_{t-1})$ and the backward pass computes $g_t = \text{LSTM\_backward}(e_t, g_{t+1})$. These are then concatenated to form the ultimate contextualized word representation $c_t = $, which is then repurposed for downstream tasks [34]. CoVe also addresses OOV words by assigning them zero vectors.
*   Modern LLMs, such as fine-tuned BERT, inherently generate highly sophisticated **contextualized embeddings**. For instance, methods like Aug-Linear extract fixed-size embeddings for input ngrams by feeding them through a fine-tuned LLM, applying its tokenizer (e.g., BERT's word-piece tokenizer), and then averaging over the token dimensions to obtain the final embedding $\phi(x_i)$ [16]. A significant advantage of these LLM-derived embeddings is their capacity to incorporate information about labels into the embeddings, particularly when the LLM is fine-tuned on a downstream prediction task. This contrasts sharply with static embeddings like GloVe, which lack task-specific contextual awareness, demonstrating a superior ability to capture nuanced, task-relevant semantics [16].

The shift from static to dynamic, contextualized embeddings represents a critical advancement, fundamentally enhancing LLMs' ability to understand and process language. While these dense, continuous representations are powerful, they also introduce challenges for certain explainability techniques, as methods like Integrated Gradients may not directly fit well with the discrete nature of input tokens in a continuous embedding space, necessitating specialized variants for effective attribution [30]. Future work in this area will likely focus on further refining these representations for even greater semantic precision and developing more robust explainability techniques that can seamlessly navigate the continuous and discrete aspects of LLM inputs.
## 3. Fundamentals of Explainable AI (XAI)
Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial field dedicated to bridging the inherent complexity of advanced AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), with human understanding of their operations [11,31]. In an era where opaque "black-box" models are increasingly prevalent, XAI serves as a foundational solution to address critical issues of transparency, interpretability, and trust [14,31].

The overarching goal of XAI is to render AI behavior comprehensible to humans, thereby fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and maximizing the ethical and practical utility of AI systems [11,32]. This encompasses a range of objectives, from enhancing human understanding of how LLMs derive predictions and elucidating their behaviors and limitations [13,27], to building and calibrating appropriate trust among end-users and facilitating debugging and optimization for developers [11,27]. Furthermore, XAI is indispensable for promoting the responsible and ethical application of AI, identifying biases, mitigating risks, and ensuring regulatory compliance, especially in high-stakes domains [11,27].

To systematically approach these goals, explainability methods are categorized along several key dimensions, providing a structured framework for analysis. These classifications differentiate explanations based on their scope—whether they focus on a single prediction (local) or the model's overall behavior (global) [15,32]. Another critical distinction lies in the timing of explanation generation, separating post-hoc methods, which apply after a model's training, from intrinsic (or ante-hoc) approaches that embed interpretability directly into the model's design [15,32]. Explanations can also be model-specific, leveraging internal model structures, or model-agnostic, treating the AI as a black box based solely on input-output behavior [15,32].



![Key Principles of Human-Centered XAI (HCXAI)](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/_bndxknFqpAu7usgbMyBI_Key%20Principles%20of%20Human-Centered%20XAI%20%28HCXAI%29.png)

A significant paradigm shift in the field is the emergence of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI), which moves beyond mere technical transparency to a socio-technical approach, prioritizing the understanding of "who needs transparency and why" [2,6]. This perspective recognizes the diverse landscape of AI users, from developers to end-users and domain experts, each with distinct needs and cognitive capabilities, necessitating tailored and context-specific explanations [15,31]. HCXAI emphasizes contextual, personalized, and user-friendly explanations that align with human cognition and promote appropriate trust, even re-evaluating the fidelity of LLM-generated "explanations" to prioritize critical thinking over assumed internal faithfulness [7,8]. Such an approach inherently demands interdisciplinary collaboration and focuses on fostering human-AI collaboration and ensuring robust human oversight in AI-driven decision-making processes [9,14].

Despite these advancements, the inherent opacity of LLMs, with their vast parameters and complex emergent behaviors, presents ongoing challenges in achieving comprehensive and causally sound insights [15]. The field of XAI for LLMs continues to navigate complex trade-offs between scalability, faithfulness, and usability across these diverse explanation types, constantly evolving to meet the demands of responsible AI development and deployment [15].
### 3.1 Definition and Goals of XAI
Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a critical field designed to bridge the chasm between the inherent complexity of advanced AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), and human comprehension of their operations [11,31]. This foundational understanding frames XAI not merely as a technical pursuit but as a crucial solution to transparency, interpretability, and trust issues that arise from opaque "black-box" models [14,31].

The overarching goal of XAI is to render AI behavior understandable to humans, thereby fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and maximizing the ethical and practical utility of AI systems [11,32]. This consensus is echoed across numerous studies, which delineate several interconnected objectives:

1.  **Enhancing Human Understanding and Comprehensibility**: A primary aim of XAI is to articulate a model's internal logic and outputs in a manner accessible to human users [13,27]. This involves providing clear insights into how LLMs derive their predictions [12,13] and elucidating their behaviors, limitations, and potential societal impacts [1,26]. The need for such understanding extends to critical evaluation, especially when LLMs produce outputs of variable quality, approximations, or logical inconsistencies, necessitating human interpretability and critical thinking [28].

2.  **Building and Calibrating Trust**: A consistently highlighted goal is the establishment of appropriate trust among end-users [11,16]. By explaining the reasoning mechanisms behind predictions, XAI empowers users to comprehend an LLM's functions, limitations, and potential flaws without requiring technical expertise, thus fostering confidence in AI-supported applications [19,30].

3.  **Facilitating Debugging, Improvement, and Optimization**: For researchers and developers, XAI provides invaluable insights into model behavior, serving as a critical debugging aid [25,27]. It enables the identification of unexpected biases, risks, and areas for performance enhancement, ultimately contributing to improved model reliability and safety [11,13].

4.  **Ensuring Accountability, Ethical Deployment, and Regulatory Compliance**: XAI is paramount for promoting the responsible and ethical application of AI, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policy-making [11,16]. It helps identify biases (e.g., gender bias), mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with strict regulations such as GDPR [11,27]. Moreover, XAI contributes to tracking model capabilities over time and auditing powerful models for alignment with human values [30].

While these common goals form the bedrock of XAI, the field also presents nuanced differences and challenges. One significant distinction lies in the definition of explainability versus interpretability: explainability often refers to communicating how AI systems make decisions, especially for black-box models, whereas interpretability pertains to understanding a model's internal mechanisms, typically for simpler models [17]. However, in the context of LLMs, both terms frequently converge due to their inherent opacity.

A critical appraisal of XAI's goals reveals evolving perspectives. The goal of XAI for LLMs has expanded beyond mere technical introspection to support human interaction, trust calibration, and decision assurance, serving diverse cognitive, functional, and ethical purposes [15]. This highlights that the definition and goals of XAI are not monolithic but vary based on the specific stakeholders involved—developers, regulators, domain experts, and end-users—necessitating tailored explanations in terms of content, modality, timing, and presentation format [6,15]. For instance, a medical professional might require causally sound, contextually relevant explanations for patient diagnosis [4,20], while a security expert might focus on understanding internal jailbreak mechanisms to develop robust defenses [18].

A unique perspective challenges the very nature of explanations generated by LLMs themselves. Some research argues that LLM-generated explanations do not accurately reflect the mechanical processes underlying predictions, instead creating an "illusion" of reasoning, termed "exoplanations" [7]. This challenges the fundamental goal of XAI when applied to LLM self-explanation, suggesting that true internal mechanism disclosure might still be elusive. Future development trajectories for XAI will likely emphasize not only the generation of explanations but also their *quality*, *fidelity*, and *contextual relevance*, moving towards frameworks like System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML) that integrate interpretability and explainability directly into system design, offering evidence-based explanations from internal representations rather than merely post-hoc justifications [17]. This ensures that XAI continues to serve as an important bridge between complexity and trust, substantiated by rigorous technical analysis and practical utility [15,31].
### 3.2 Types of Explainability (Local/Global, Post-hoc/Intrinsic, etc.)

**Core Types of Explainability Methods**

| Dimension        | Category             | Description                                                              | Examples (for LLMs)                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**        | **Local**            | Explains a single prediction for a specific input instance.              | LIME, SHAP (instance-wise), Token Saliency              |
|                  | **Global**           | Explains overall model behavior, knowledge, or internal workings.        | Probing Classifiers, Representation Clustering, Circuit Tracing |
| **Timing**       | **Post-hoc**         | Explanations generated after model training and prediction.              | LIME, SHAP, Attention Visualizations                    |
|                  | **Intrinsic (Ante-hoc)** | Interpretability built directly into model design or training.           | Concept Bottleneck Models, Self-rationalizing LLMs (CoT) |
| **Dependence**   | **Model-specific**   | Exploits internal structure and parameters of a particular LLM.          | Attention Head Analysis, Neuron Tracing, Gradient-based |
|                  | **Model-agnostic**   | Treats LLM as a black box; explains via input-output behavior.         | LIME, SHAP, Permutation Feature Importance              |

The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a structured categorization of explanation types to systematically address their diverse goals, scopes, and implementation strategies. A comprehensive framework, primarily outlined by `[32]` and corroborated by numerous other studies, classifies explainability along several key dimensions, including the scope of explanation, the timing of its generation, and its dependence on the model architecture `[15,31]`.


A fundamental distinction in explainability lies in its scope, differentiating between local and global explanations `[1,10,13,15,17,26,30,32]`.

**Local explanations** focus on understanding the rationale behind a single prediction or decision made by an LLM for a specific input instance `[13,15,22,30,32]`. These explanations typically provide token-level attributions or contextual rationales, helping users comprehend why a particular output was generated `[15]`. Common methods include token saliency maps, attention rollout visualizations, and techniques like LIME and SHAP when applied to individual instances `[15,17]`. For instance, Aug-imodels can offer local explanations by providing a score for each ngram within a single input, detailing its contribution to the prediction `[16]`. The utility of local explanations is primarily in debugging and enhancing transparency for specific user interactions `[15]`.

In contrast, **global explanations** aim to elucidate the overall behavior, internal workings, or learned knowledge of the model across a broader context `[13,15,22,30,32]`. These provide insights into the general principles governing the LLM's decision patterns, rather than focusing on isolated predictions `[26,31]`. Techniques include analyzing training dynamics, attention patterns, probing classifiers, representation clustering, circuit tracing, and inspecting fitted coefficients over an entire dataset `[15,16]`. Examples also extend to Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots, and Permutation Feature Importance, which illustrate how changes in feature values influence global predictions `[17,31]`. However, it is noteworthy that PDPs might offer misleading interpretations in the presence of correlated features `[17]`. Global explanations serve crucial needs for auditability and fairness for a wider range of stakeholders `[15]`. Mechanistic interpretability, for example, seeks to provide both local insights into specific behaviors and global understanding of LLM principles `[12]`.


Another critical dimension categorizes explainability based on when the explanation mechanism is applied: post-hoc or intrinsic `[15,17,30,31,32]`. The term "built-in" or "ante-hoc" is often used synonymously with "intrinsic" `[15,32]`.

**Post-hoc methods** involve applying interpretability techniques after an LLM has been trained and made its predictions `[15,31,32]`. These methods treat the model as a "black box" and infer explanations by perturbing inputs or analyzing outputs `[17]`. Examples include gradient attribution, saliency mapping, LIME, SHAP, attention-based visualizations, and natural language explanation generation `[15,24,31]`. While highly versatile, a significant limitation of post-hoc explanations is their potential lack of faithfulness to the true model decision-making process `[15,16]`. Critics argue that they can be "incomplete or misleading," raising reliability concerns for high-stakes applications `[16,17]`. For example, Aug-Linear models are described as yielding "exact" and "considerably more faithful" coefficients compared to post-hoc methods like LIME and SHAP `[16]`. Even when LLMs generate natural language rationales, these are often categorized as post-hoc explanations `[11]`. The ChatGPT ADA system demonstrated a form of post-hoc, local explainability through SHAP analysis to quantify feature contributions `[19]`.

Conversely, **intrinsic (or ante-hoc) approaches** embed interpretability directly into the model's design or training objectives `[15,32]`. This allows for a deeper understanding of the model's internal mechanics because the model itself is transparent `[17]`. Examples include concept bottleneck models, neural additive models, self-rationalizing architectures, and frameworks like Aug-imodels, which enable a "complete inspection of a model’s decision-making process" `[15,16]`. Mechanistic interpretability, which focuses on understanding internal components and "circuits," is also an intrinsic approach `[12]`. Intriguingly, LLMs can generate their own Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations, which can be viewed as an intrinsic form of explainability `[30]`. While intrinsic methods offer greater transparency and faithfulness, they often entail a trade-off with scalability and predictive power `[15]`. ChatGPT ADA also exhibited an intrinsic explanation by communicating its reasoning for choosing specific imputation strategies based on dataset characteristics `[19]`. Hybrid approaches, combining black-box architectures with interpretable scaffolding or incorporating transparent modules, seek to balance these trade-offs `[15,31]`.


Explainability methods can also be categorized by their reliance on the model's internal architecture `[15,31,32]`.

**Model-specific methods** exploit access to the internal structure and parameters of a particular LLM `[15,31,32]`. Examples include attention visualization, neuron tracing, gradient-based methods, and concept activation vectors `[15,18,30]`. Mechanistic interpretability is inherently model-specific, focusing on directly understanding the LLM's components `[12]`.

Conversely, **model-agnostic approaches** treat the LLM as a black box, inferring explanations solely through its input-output behavior without requiring access to internal components `[15,31,32]`. These methods are highly generalizable across various model architectures `[17,32]`. Prominent examples include LIME, SHAP, and permutation feature importance `[15,17,30]`.


Beyond these primary categorizations, several other dimensions further refine the landscape of explainability:
*   **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Explanations**: Qualitative explanations often use natural language or visualizations, making them intuitive for human users. Quantitative explanations, conversely, employ mathematical metrics to represent results, offering precise and measurable insights `[32]`.
*   **Interactive vs. Static Explanations**: Interactive explanations allow users to dynamically explore model behaviors and decision boundaries, fostering deeper understanding. Static explanations, on the other hand, provide fixed results or reports `[32]`.
*   **Semantic-aware vs. Functionality-aware Analysis**: Particularly relevant for LLMs, explainability efforts can differentiate between analyzing the meaning encoded in hidden representations (semantic-aware) and investigating contributions of specific components like layers or neurons to model behavior (functionality-aware) `[18]`.
*   **Human-Centered Narratives**: This emerging category, often empowered by LLMs themselves, focuses on generating natural language explanations that align with user cognition and build trust, transforming complex model outputs into understandable narratives `[11]`.

The inherent opacity of LLMs, stemming from their vast number of parameters and often inaccessible training data, presents significant challenges to achieving comprehensive causal insights, especially in highly nonlinear or emergent behaviors `[15]`. The ongoing research in explainability for LLMs continues to navigate complex trade-offs between scalability, faithfulness, and usability across these diverse types of explanations `[15]`. This multi-faceted classification provides a vital framework for comparing, contrasting, and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various XAI approaches.
### 3.3 Key Principles of Human-Centered XAI (HCXAI)
Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) represents a fundamental paradigm shift from purely technical explainability to a socio-technical approach, asserting that algorithmic transparency alone is insufficient for effective AI explainability [2,6]. This perspective fundamentally reorients the focus from merely "how to open the black box" to understanding "who needs transparency and why" [2], emphasizing the human actor's central role in the explanation process [6]. Such a shift is crucial in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), where the complexity and emergent behaviors necessitate a deeper consideration of human interaction and understanding [24].

A core principle of HCXAI is the recognition of the "exceedingly varied landscape of the AI users," encompassing a diverse range of stakeholders such as developers, regulators, domain experts, end-users, patients, and students [15,31]. Each group possesses distinct expectations, requirements, and cognitive capabilities, necessitating individually tailored explanation strategies [15,31]. For instance, explanations for medical professionals must address accuracy, relevance, and potential harm, while patients prioritize user intent fulfillment and helpfulness [20]. Similarly, students or non-professional programmers require explanations tailored to foster critical thinking and provide "bespoke advice and feedback" in an approachable language [28]. This calls for a nuanced understanding of specific user needs and contexts [24,32].

HCXAI advocates for contextual and personalized explanations that align with human cognition. The TAXAL framework, for example, integrates a "Cognitive Dimension" that focuses on how explanations align with user understanding, emphasizing plausibility, comprehensibility, and trust calibration through adaptive strategies such as natural language rationales and dialogic interfaces [15]. Similarly, the "Human-Centered Narratives" approach leverages natural language to bridge the gap between complex AI outputs and human understanding, converting model predictions into narratives tailored to user cognition, as exemplified in medical contexts where weighted risk factors are presented to build trust [11]. The System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML) framework further illustrates this by integrating insights from social and natural sciences, proposing that AI contextual explanations should be structured as an $Contextual Explanation_{\text{AI}} = \text{Context}(\text{Inference} + \text{Evidence})$ pair to ensure context-awareness and alignment with human reasoning [17]. This framework also draws from cognitive science, suggesting that explanations are contrastive ("why P instead of Q") and prioritize causal factors over statistical probabilities, reflecting human biases in selecting relevant information [17].

Moving beyond mere technical fidelity, HCXAI prioritizes the usability and perceived quality of explanations to foster appropriate trust and prevent misinformation [4]. While XAI aims to establish "appropriate trust" by clarifying reasoning, current LLM-generated explanations often exhibit low "simulation precision," potentially misleading humans into forming incorrect mental models [30]. Critically, evaluations based solely on subjective human judgment can be unreliable if they do not align with the model's actual reasoning [30]. This underscores the challenge of striking a balance between human plausibility and model faithfulness. Some research even suggests that LLM-generated "explanations" (termed "exoplanations") should be utilized more for "promoting critical thinking rather than for understanding the model," given their inherent unfaithfulness to internal mechanics, thus prioritizing human cognitive utility over assumed fidelity [7]. This perspective highlights the necessity for "Usable XAI," which focuses on practical utility and acceptance by reformatting complex numerical XAI outputs into comprehensible textual descriptions [8].

The successful implementation of HCXAI inherently demands an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach. Calls for "broader perspectives and collaborative efforts" and "interdisciplinary cooperation" are common, bringing together experts from diverse fields to synchronize research agendas and ensure practical applicability [14]. The SoS-ML framework explicitly integrates insights from linguistics (Chomsky’s Innatist Theory and Vygotsky’s Social Interactionist Theory) and cognitive science to inform AI architecture design, suggesting intrinsic modularity and collaborative functional units for explainability [17]. This collective effort helps design XAI systems that improve human-AI interaction, enable users to engage effectively with AI, and support decision assurance [15,31].

In practice, HCXAI manifests in models that foster human-AI collaboration and ensure human oversight. For instance, in scientific peer review, LLMs can handle "exhaustive, time-consuming analytical work," allowing human experts to focus on "final judgment, strategic direction, and creative insight," with human arbiters receiving "coherent dossier containing three distinct analytical viewpoints" from LLM personas [9]. This augments, rather than replaces, human intellect. Similarly, in fields like coding, LLMs serve as "personal tutors" while emphasizing that humans still require a basic understanding of coding to interpret and verify LLM outputs, underscoring the indispensable role of human oversight and critical thinking [28]. Visual analytics systems like NeuroBreak also embody HCXAI principles by combining automated pattern mining with interactive human-centered interfaces, developed in cooperation with domain experts to ensure effectiveness and interpretability [18].

Human evaluation is considered an "essential tool" for assessing the efficacy of HCXAI principles, focusing on aspects like "perceived fidelity" and "perceived interpretability," which are moderated by user trust and curiosity [4]. Multi-dimensional human assessments, including those by experienced physicians and patients, ensure that the utility of LLM outputs is evaluated from diverse end-user perspectives [20]. Ultimately, HCXAI principles are crucial for building trust and ensuring the ethical deployment of LLMs, preparing the ground for discussions on "Usable XAI" that prioritize effective usage and understanding by humans with varying technical backgrounds [8,24]. These principles call for actionable interventions, design guidelines, transferable evaluation methods, and accountability mechanisms at conceptual, methodological, and technical levels, encompassing historical, sociological, and technical dimensions for a holistic understanding [6].
## 4. Fundamental Challenges of LLM Explainability
The rapid proliferation and increasing sophistication of Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought their remarkable capabilities into sharp focus, yet concurrently illuminated a spectrum of fundamental challenges regarding their explainability. Understanding these challenges is paramount for fostering trust, ensuring responsible deployment, and advancing the scientific development of LLMs.

This section provides a high-level overview of the core obstacles hindering comprehensive explainability, establishing a theoretical framework for the subsequent detailed discussions [15,30,31].

At the heart of the explainability dilemma lies the **Model Complexity and Opacity** inherent in LLM architectures. Characterized by billions of parameters and intricate internal representations, these models operate as "black boxes," making it exceedingly difficult to trace internal reasoning, decompose decision-making processes, or infer precise neuron functionality [10,22,30]. This opacity is not merely a technical hurdle but propagates into systemic issues, giving rise to profound **Data Dependency and Biases**. LLMs invariably absorb and can amplify biases, factual inaccuracies, and quality issues present in their vast training datasets, leading to inequitable outputs and flawed reasoning. The difficulty in assessing the impact of this data on model behavior further complicates bias detection and mitigation efforts, underscoring the critical link between data provenance and ethical model operation [22,28,31].

Compounding these issues is the pervasive problem of **Output Uncertainty and Hallucinations**. LLMs often produce non-deterministic, inconsistent, or factually incorrect outputs that sound plausible, undermining reliability and trust, especially in high-stakes applications [10,30]. These hallucinations stem from a combination of dataset limitations and the model's inherent probabilistic nature, where linguistic fluency can override factual accuracy [34]. The combined effect of opacity, data-driven biases, and unreliable outputs precipitates significant **Ethical, Safety, and Privacy Concerns**. Without adequate explainability, LLMs risk perpetuating discrimination, spreading misinformation, infringing on privacy through sensitive data processing, and posing safety risks in critical domains, necessitating rigorous auditing and alignment with human values [11,24].

Furthermore, the advancement of LLM explainability is hampered by **Insufficient Evaluation Metrics and Standards**. The subjective nature of a "good" explanation, coupled with the absence of unified metrics for qualities like faithfulness and fidelity, makes it challenging to compare, validate, and improve XAI techniques [31,32]. Existing automatic metrics often lack correlation with human judgment, and the scarcity of tailored benchmarks for diverse contexts further exacerbates this gap [20,29]. This leads directly to a crucial dilemma concerning the **Faithfulness vs. Plausibility of Explanations**. LLMs often generate explanations that appear plausible to human users but do not accurately reflect their actual internal reasoning processes, creating a deceptive sense of understanding and potentially fostering over-reliance on unreliable outputs [7,15].

Finally, the pursuit of LLM explainability is constrained by persistent **Trade-offs: Accuracy, Interpretability, and Scalability**. Enhancing interpretability often comes at the cost of model accuracy or computational efficiency, while the immense scale of LLMs renders traditional explanation methods computationally prohibitive [16,30]. This tension necessitates innovative strategies that can balance these competing demands without compromising performance or the ability to generate meaningful explanations. Overarching all these challenges is the critical need to address **Stakeholder Diversity and Contextual Needs**. Effective explainability is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it requires explanations tailored to the specific goals, technical understanding, and contextual requirements of diverse users, from end-users to developers, regulators, and domain experts [2,15].

In essence, the fundamental challenges to LLM explainability are deeply interconnected, ranging from the intrinsic properties of the models themselves to their societal impacts and the practicalities of their evaluation and deployment. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that integrates technical innovations with human-centered design principles to build truly transparent, trustworthy, and responsible LLM systems.
### 4.1 Model Complexity and Opacity
The inherent complexity and resulting opacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a foundational challenge for explainability, widely recognized across the literature [15,30,31,32]. LLMs are characterized by an immense scale, possessing billions to hundreds of billions of parameters, and are trained on vast datasets, leading to highly intricate internal representations and decision-making processes that are difficult to interpret [10,30,32,34]. This fundamental complexity contributes to their "black-box" nature, where understanding the internal reasoning chains and specific decision processes remains challenging, even for open-source models such as Llama-2 [10,22,24,30]. Consequently, analysis is often limited to input-output observations, failing to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms [10,22].

The technical facets of LLM opacity stem from several factors. The sheer scale and intricate internal representations of LLMs render it computationally expensive and practically difficult to decompose contributions from different layers or infer precise neuron functionality [22]. Specifically, disentangling and attributing the progressive construction of output semantics across layers is challenging, as representations across different layers are often not directly comparable and reside in distinct semantic spaces [18]. Similarly, inferring the functionality of critical neurons is complicated by their highly intertwined operation within a layer and across subsequent layers, making it difficult to isolate their individual roles [18]. Furthermore, the knowledge learned by LLMs is implicitly embedded within their weights, and their decision-making involves complex non-linear transformations, further obscuring traceability [32]. The autoregressive nature of multi-step reasoning trajectories, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, inherently makes the computational process difficult to decompose into discrete, understandable steps, thus rendering traditional, single-step explanation methods insufficient [3]. Even current explainability techniques that rely on proxies like attention weights or saliency maps are often limited in providing true causal insight, especially within highly nonlinear or emergent contexts [15].

While papers such as [22] outline the fundamental, architecture-driven challenges to LLM explainability—focusing on the difficulty of interpreting intricate inference processes and tracing internal reasoning due to billions of parameters—other works highlight the LLM-specific challenges and practical hurdles for XAI. For instance, [8] emphasizes that the immense parameter count significantly limits the applicability and efficiency of existing explanation algorithms, necessitating novel approaches for generative tasks that differ from traditional classification-centric methods.

These LLM-specific challenges extend beyond just their internal architecture:
*   **Generative Tasks and Emergent Abilities**: The unique requirements of explaining generative tasks and emergent capabilities, including in-context learning (ICL), CoT prompting, and the phenomenon of hallucination, add significant layers of complexity to their interpretation [30,32]. Hallucinations and the lack of inherent reasoning capacity can instill a "certain degree of doubt" regarding an LLM's capacity to provide adequate explanations [4].
*   **Computational Cost**: Generating explanations for LLMs demands substantial computational resources, rendering traditional feature attribution techniques, such as gradient-based methods and SHAP values, less practical for real-world applications [30]. This computational burden also translates into significant energy costs and deployment challenges, particularly in low-compute settings [16], and can impede real-time applications where operational latency is critical, such as jailbreak detection [15]. The sheer scale of LLMs also creates significant challenges for computation and memory during training and serving, impacting latency and resource utilization [23].
*   **Ethical and User-Centric Challenges**: The opacity of LLMs creates trust and transparency issues, particularly in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where strict regulations (e.g., GDPR) necessitate explainability [11,20,24]. This "black-box" nature risks misuse, impacts critical thinking, and raises ethical dilemmas regarding fairness, hate speech, and privacy from sensitive data leakage [24].
*   **Reproducibility**: The inherent "degree of randomness" in LLM responses can impact reproducibility, making it difficult to trace specific decision paths or ensure consistent outputs [28].

Despite the common agreement on LLM's opacity, there are contrasting views on addressing it. Some papers, such as [6], question whether "opening the black box" remains a realistic goal for XAI given the immense complexity, suggesting a shift in focus. This contrasts with approaches aiming for direct understanding, such as mechanistic interpretability, which proposes replacing dense neural network components with sparse, interpretable alternatives to reveal complex internal workings [12]. Furthermore, the observation that LLM-generated explanations often fail to "accurately reflect the mechanical process underlying the prediction" and are merely emergent properties, not true windows into the black-box mechanics [7], highlights a critical limitation of current explanation paradigms and calls for a re-evaluation of the concept of explanation itself. This underscores the need for the XAI community to engage more deeply with these specific challenges, as noted in [24], and potentially adopt design-time transparency instead of relying solely on post-hoc methods for opaque models [17].
### 4.2 Data Dependency and Biases
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a profound dependence on the extensive text corpora utilized during their training, a fundamental characteristic that significantly influences their operational behaviors and outputs [10,22,34]. This strong data dependency means that biases and errors inherent in these massive datasets are not only reflected but can also be amplified and propagated within the model's operation, leading to a range of undesirable outcomes [22,28,31,34].

The manifestation of these data-driven biases is diverse and pervasive. LLMs can acquire incorrect factual knowledge, rendering them unsuitable for tasks requiring high factual accuracy [21]. Beyond factual inaccuracies, training for specific behaviors, such as safety and harmlessness, can lead to preferential responses, as exemplified by ChatGPT's inclination towards positive assessments or refusal to rate content (e.g., "As an AI, I cannot experience pleasure") [21]. More broadly, LLMs perpetuate social biases related to sex, gender, race, and religion, often leading to inequitable outputs [31,34]. Concrete examples include LLMs associating "doctor" with male and "nurse" with female pronouns [27]. Historical cases outside of LLMs, such as the COMPAS algorithm's racial bias, Google's image recognition system mistagging African Americans as "gorillas," IBM Watson for Oncology's unsafe recommendations, and Apple's credit card algorithm exhibiting gender discrimination, underscore the critical need for explainability in detecting and mitigating such biases that originate from biased training data [17]. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluators themselves suffer from various biases, including positional bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limitations in numerical scoring, while reference-free metrics can show bias towards their underlying models’ outputs [29]. A systemic bias in training data also stems from its geographic and linguistic composition, predominantly focusing on materials from wealthy nations and well-represented languages on the internet, which raises concerns about equitable access and benefit from AI [28].

Beyond explicit biases, data quality issues can lead to significant performance degradation. Hallucinations in LLMs are often traceable to problems within their datasets, specifically a lack of relevant data, which results in poor learning of "long-tail knowledge," and the detrimental effect of repeated data [25,30]. For instance, studies indicate that merely 10% data repetition can reduce the performance of an 800M parameter model to that of a 400M parameter model, as the model "memorizes" rather than learns [30]. Shortcut learning is another critical issue, where LLMs in fine-tuning paradigms exploit dataset artifacts (e.g., lexical, overlap, positional biases), significantly impairing out-of-distribution generalization. In prompting, models demonstrate superficial understanding by performing best when relevant information is at the beginning or end of a context rather than in the middle, indicating a reliance on patterns rather than deep comprehension [30]. The limited domain-specific content and presence of unverified information in general LLM training data can also hinder their effectiveness in specialized fields, as observed in medical contexts where general models provided inaccurate answers and showed higher rates of biased content (GPT-3.5 at 13.3%, GPT-4 at 9.5% compared to specialized DocOA at 2.8%) [20]. Moreover, gaps in training data coverage, such as exclusion of paywalled scholarly articles, highlight issues with data quality's influence on the model's ability to provide comprehensive and unbiased reviews [9]. The evaluation of jailbreak detection systems further demonstrates dataset scope and generalizability limitations, where synthetic, established methods may not capture the diversity of real-world adversarial attacks [18].

A major challenge for explainability (XAI) is the inherent difficulty in fully assessing and understanding the intricate impact of training data quality on an LLM's performance and characteristics [10,22]. The "black-box" nature of many LLMs exacerbates this, making it arduous to detect potential biases originating from the training data or the model's learning process, thereby hindering trust and accountability, particularly in critical applications [11,24]. Ethical AI and Responsible AI frameworks critically depend on XAI to address these data dependency and bias concerns [14,31]. Crucially, XAI approaches must not only detect and explain existing biases but also ensure that the explanation process itself does not introduce new biases, navigating the complex landscape of fairness and accountability [31].

To mitigate these challenges, explainability plays a pivotal role. The SoS-ML framework, for instance, integrates context-aware explanations and functional interpretability to explicitly detect and mitigate biases within its modular components [17]. Similarly, the InterpretableLLM framework incorporates a "bias detection module" designed to trace the origins of model bias, such as training data and model structure, thereby ensuring fairness [32]. Explainability tools, including tracking training data attribution and visualizing attention patterns, are instrumental in revealing embedded biases like gender stereotypes, while probing classifiers can identify problematic associations within learned representations [30]. Furthermore, interpretable gradient flows and counterfactual analysis are highlighted as crucial for mitigating social bias [15]. Proactive data collection and preprocessing, encompassing data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation, are recognized as foundational steps to filter noise, reduce bias, and expand datasets for increased model robustness, ensuring LLMs learn from representative features rather than noise [23]. The explicit acknowledgment that LLMs "struggle with issues such as fairness" due to data dependencies underscores the necessity of interpretable models for effective diagnosis and mitigation [16]. Ultimately, understanding and explaining LLMs are paramount for elucidating their profound "social impacts," which are invariably shaped by the biases inherited from their training data [1]. The future trajectory of XAI for LLMs will increasingly focus on developing robust, quantifiable methods for data bias detection, attribution, and algorithmic correction, moving beyond mere identification to proactive and preventative measures throughout the LLM lifecycle.
### 4.3 Output Uncertainty and Hallucinations
A critical challenge in the explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from their inherent output uncertainty and propensity for generating "hallucinations" [10,22]. These phenomena significantly complicate the task of explaining model behavior, hindering trust and reliable deployment across various applications [1,10].

Output uncertainty manifests when LLMs produce different, sometimes inconsistent or incorrect, outputs for the same input, making their behavior non-deterministic and difficult to predict or explain [10,22]. This variability is particularly disconcerting for novice users of tools like LLM-generated code, where the same prompt can yield non-reproducible results [28]. The recognition of this issue has led to approaches emphasizing the importance of "communicating uncertainty" as a core aspect of LLM transparency [2] and the need for "不确定性表达" (expression of uncertainty) in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis [32].

Hallucinations represent a more severe form of output uncertainty, characterized by the generation of plausible-sounding but false, incorrect, or contextually inappropriate assertions [30,34]. LLMs can often be "completely confident in a response even when that response is inaccurate or entirely incorrect" [28]. This phenomenon arises from the model's probabilistic nature, where it prioritizes grammatical correctness and linguistic patterns over strict factual verification or robust reasoning [28,30,34].

The causes of hallucinations are multi-faceted, encompassing:
1.  **Dataset Issues**: These include a lack of relevant data (e.g., long-tail knowledge) and the presence of repeated or conflicting data in training sets [30]. Hallucinations are also more likely when prompts lack sufficient context or when training data itself contains mistakes [28]. Even advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are not immune, as the "fundamental reason for the errors stems from the inherent limitations of the RAG technology, where the retrieved information may sometimes be incomplete or may not adequately address the question," leading to effectively incorrect output despite infrequent outright hallucinations [20].
2.  **Model Limitations**: LLMs primarily rely on "sentence-level memory and corpus-level statistical patterns" rather than robust semantic understanding or logical deduction [30]. They demonstrate imperfections in "remembering and reasoning about ontological knowledge" and can suffer from "logical derivations due to the inversion curse" [30]. Furthermore, LLMs tend to be "overconfident in their outputs," struggle to "accurately identify factual knowledge boundaries," and may prefer "co-occurring words over factual answers" (shortcut learning) or exhibit "flattery" by conforming to user views, which can be exacerbated with model scaling and instruction tuning [30]. Mechanistic interpretability is being employed to understand these underlying mechanisms, such as distinct recognition and recall circuits, which is a crucial step towards mitigation [12].

These issues pose significant risks across diverse fields, including education, news, and healthcare, where inaccurate or misleading outputs can have severe consequences [24,27]. For instance, in LLM-generated code, challenges include "variable quality," difficulties with "mathematics, logic, non-reproducibility," and general "mistakes" [28,29]. Hallucinations are also more prevalent with "less frequently used analytical methods, packages or programming languages" [28].

Crucially, factual inaccuracies and inconsistent outputs are not limited to generative tasks but also present critical challenges when LLMs function as evaluators [21]. For example, when used for tasks like assessing story "likability," LLMs may produce unreliable scores or even refuse to provide evaluations by stating limitations (e.g., "I am an AI system and do not possess emotions like humans") [21]. This complicates the justification of their judgments and necessitates human verification for critical claims [9]. Factuality-based metrics like SRLScore and QAFactEval are being developed to assess whether generated text contains "incorrect information that does not hold true to the source text" [29].

To mitigate these challenges, several approaches are being explored. Enhancing LLM accuracy, educating users about potential limitations, and developing robust fact-checking systems are paramount [24]. Specific frameworks, like SAX4BPM, aim to address the "tendency for hallucination" in business process explanations by using external input and "guard-railing" LLM performance [4]. For code generation, even when low hallucination rates are observed (e.g., ChatGPT ADA in statistical analysis), "specific safeguarding measures" such as providing intermediary code and increasing user awareness remain crucial [19]. Transparency methods that allow LLMs to "self-explain refusal behavior" or flag issues for human review also play a role in risk detection [15].

Explainability techniques are vital for diagnosing and addressing these issues. Functional explanations serve as "diagnostic tools" for identifying "systemic issues such as hallucinations" [15]. Methods like attribution and causal tracing can be employed to "reduce hallucinations through attention-based interventions and saliency-guided filtering" [15]. Furthermore, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods are being explored, including consistency-based estimation (generating multiple answers and assessing their agreement), language model verbalization (LLMs directly expressing confidence levels), and token-level uncertainty aggregation [30]. While logit-based UQ is often unsuitable for LLMs, especially closed-source models, non-logit-based "confidence elicitation" techniques are gaining traction [30]. Frameworks like SoS-ML improve confidence measures by generating reliance scores and confidence intervals, demonstrating more robust indicators of uncertainty than single black-box models [17].

In summary, output uncertainty and hallucinations represent fundamental hurdles to the trustworthiness and deployability of LLMs. While progress is being made in understanding their root causes—from data imperfections to inherent model limitations—and developing methods for detection, mitigation, and quantification of uncertainty, human oversight and robust explainability mechanisms remain indispensable. Future research is expected to further refine UQ techniques, develop more sophisticated diagnostic tools, and integrate explainability throughout the LLM lifecycle to enhance reliability and user trust.
### 4.4 Ethical, Safety, and Privacy Concerns
The widespread deployment and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought to the forefront a myriad of ethical, safety, and privacy concerns, demanding rigorous attention and the proactive integration of Explainable AI (XAI) technologies [8,24,30]. XAI is posited as a crucial bridge to navigate the complexity of LLMs and build trust, fostering the development of Ethical AI, Trustworthy AI, and Responsible AI systems [14,31].

A primary ethical concern revolves around **bias and fairness**. LLMs, being trained on vast datasets, inevitably inherit and perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to undesirable and often discriminatory outputs [28]. This bias can manifest in various forms, from racial bias in judicial algorithms like COMPAS to gender bias in credit card algorithms, and even in code generation [17,28]. The lack of transparency in LLMs exacerbates these issues, making it challenging to identify and mitigate biases, which poses significant ethical considerations, particularly in sensitive fields like medicine [20]. Researchers emphasize the need to eliminate bias and control offensive outputs, with explainability serving as a vital tool for auditing these models and ensuring alignment with human values [10,30,33]. Tools for tracking training data attribution or visualizing attention patterns are critical for revealing embedded biases, such as gender stereotypes, and for identifying problematic associations within the model's learned representations [30].

Beyond bias, the potential for **misinformation, hate speech, and social manipulation** presents significant societal risks. LLMs can be misused to generate malicious content, bypass moderation systems, or spread information pollution, which could lead to social manipulation [10,24,30]. The "illusion" that LLMs reflect genuine reasoning processes can further exacerbate these harms by leading to unwarranted trust in potentially unfaithful explanations [7]. This necessitates robust safety mechanisms and a deep understanding of LLM reasoning to debug and identify safety risks, providing critical intervention points for improving model reliability [3,18].

**Academic integrity and intellectual property (IP)** are also under scrutiny. The increased use of LLMs raises concerns about the originality of scientific writing and analyses [28]. Critical issues arise regarding credit and liability for code or content generated by LLMs, including potential copyright infringement, where the human author typically bears responsibility [28]. The commercial and proprietary nature of many LLMs also raises concerns about commercial bias conflicting with unbiased scientific deliberation [19]. Transparency regulations, strict model auditing, and external oversight committees are proposed as mitigation strategies to ensure accountability and prevent misuse [30].

**Privacy concerns** are paramount, especially given LLMs' capacity to process and retain vast amounts of natural language data, which often contains personal and sensitive information [34]. In clinical research, for instance, the temptation for users to disclose confidential patient data to maximize efficiency creates significant risks, compounded by models continuously training on user interactions that cannot be deleted [19]. This places a considerable responsibility on users to weigh benefits against risks [19]. Few studies adequately address privacy in LLM innovations, particularly concerning informed consent and data protection measures like anonymization or sanitization, highlighting a gap in research and practice [34]. A critical challenge lies in balancing the need for detailed explanations with the imperative to protect sensitive information, especially under stringent regulations such as GDPR and the EU AI Act [11,31]. This tension between transparency and privacy necessitates integrating privacy protection mechanisms directly into model design [23].

**Safety risks** are amplified in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and law, where the opacity of black-box LLMs creates significant trust issues [16,24,27]. Systemic risks include jailbreak vulnerabilities, hallucinations, and model uncertainty, which can lead to severe consequences [15]. For instance, in medical applications, a study involving DocOA, a RAG-enhanced LLM, found that a standard GPT-3.5 model had a 20% likelihood of producing harmful content and a 10.5% likelihood of severe harm, whereas DocOA significantly reduced these to 8.3% and 3.5% respectively, by improving explainability and source identification [20]. This demonstrates how enhancing explainability can directly quantify and reduce the risk of harm. The failure to recognize obstacles by AI systems like Tesla's Autopilot and the provision of incorrect recommendations by IBM Watson for Oncology illustrate past safety risks associated with a lack of explainability, leading to distrust and ethical concerns [17]. Moreover, LLMs face vulnerabilities to malicious attacks like command and prompt injections, particularly in critical sectors, emphasizing the need for strengthened security measures [23].

The broader **societal impact** extends to **global inequities** and **environmental concerns**. The high cost of developing and maintaining LLMs risks widening the gap in computing resources globally [28]. Furthermore, the substantial energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and resource demands associated with LLM training and operation pose a significant environmental footprint, necessitating a focus on green computing and energy efficiency [23,28].

**Explainability (XAI) plays a pivotal role in mitigating these challenges**. It is indispensable for understanding LLM social impacts and controlling their negative effects [1,26]. XAI provides the necessary transparency for ensuring legal accountability, fairness, and inclusive governance, especially in high-risk environments [15]. By integrating context-aware explanations and functional interpretability from the design phase, frameworks like SoS-ML proactively detect and mitigate biases [17]. A human-centered perspective in XAI is crucial for understanding the impact of explanations and ensuring responsible AI deployment, focusing on stakeholder needs and accountability [2,6]. This includes balancing transparency with the prevention of sensitive information disclosure, particularly under regulations such as GDPR and the EU AI Act [31].

Unique ethical considerations also arise with **LLM-based evaluation systems**. While LLMs can mitigate the ethical burden on human evaluators by reducing exposure to harmful content, they can also introduce their own biases and generate harmful responses, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of their assessments [21]. This highlights that even safety-trained LLMs require careful scrutiny, acknowledging that human evaluators also exhibit biases [21]. The proposed solution is to view LLMs not as replacements, but as alternatives or complements to human assessment, especially for sensitive tasks [21]. Moreover, LLM-augmented systems for tasks like peer review aim to remove human biases, yet still require human verification of critical claims for safety and accountability [9].

In summary, the ethical, safety, and privacy concerns surrounding LLMs are multifaceted and deeply intertwined. They encompass issues from model inherent biases and misinformation generation to data privacy infringements and systemic risks in critical applications. Explainability is not merely a technical pursuit but an ethical imperative, crucial for auditing LLMs, aligning them with human values, ensuring accountability, and ultimately fostering public trust in these increasingly powerful AI systems [22,30]. The ongoing challenge lies in developing robust XAI methods that can provide meaningful insights without compromising privacy, and in establishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks that mandate transparency and accountability across the LLM lifecycle [24]. Future research must continue to explore mechanisms for aligning advanced AI systems with human values, confronting the complexities of defining and instilling "values" in artificial intelligence [34].
### 4.5 Insufficient Evaluation Metrics and Standards
The evaluation of explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a complex, multifaceted challenge that extends significantly beyond traditional metrics of model accuracy or plausibility [15]. A pervasive issue across the field of Explainable AI (XAI), and particularly in the LLM era, is the fundamental "non-availability of standard metrics for evaluating quality in terms of explanation," compounded by the highly subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" explanation, which varies drastically by application and context [31]. This inherent subjectivity severely impedes the comparison and improvement of diverse XAI approaches [31], leading to a "lack of unified standards and methods to evaluate the quality and accuracy of explanations" [32]. Consequently, numerous surveys and research agendas implicitly or explicitly acknowledge the critical need to standardize and improve evaluation methodologies for LLM explainability, underscoring current insufficiencies and identifying "Benchmark and Metrics" as a key area requiring further investigation [1,2,11,14,24,26].

A significant limitation of current practices lies in the inadequacy of automatic evaluation metrics for comprehensively reflecting LLM explainability, especially within conversational systems [8,10,22]. Many existing automated metrics, such as semantic similarity, often exhibit "poor correlation with human evaluators," suffer from "inherent bias," and lack the adaptability to capture subtle linguistic nuances or the interpretability required for a wider variety of tasks [29]. This gap necessitates a critical shift toward "user-informed outcomes-driven protocols" and human-centric metrics that are more aligned with human understanding [8,10,15,22]. For instance, a "rigorous user study" utilizing a "designated scale" was required to evaluate the perceived quality of explanations in business processes, indicating that automated metrics were insufficient for such human-centered assessments [4]. Research highlights the importance of stronger evaluation protocols grounded in human studies and causal reasoning, advocating for the evaluation of explanations based on task success and human feedback rather than solely agreement with ground truth [15]. The TAXAL-based validation framework, for example, proposes measuring stakeholder-centered metrics like trust calibration, comprehension accuracy, and counterfactual plausibility, developing scoring matrices for alignment [15]. Similarly, the proposed SoS-ML framework identifies critical new areas for evaluation metrics, including agent collaboration effectiveness, context-specific evaluation, modular error tracing, and the influence of human feedback, all aimed at assessing alignment with human cognition and social specifications [17].

Furthermore, a critical challenge arises from the absence of unified standards for measuring key qualities of explanations, such as faithfulness and fidelity [10,22]. The problem is exacerbated by the "lack of ground truth" explanations for LLMs, with "no benchmark datasets to evaluate global explanations," making it arduous to design accurate explanation algorithms or select appropriate methods [30]. Existing evaluation metrics frequently demonstrate "inconsistent" results even for the same explanation model; for example, an explanation ranked highest by Decision Flip - Fraction Of Tokens (DFFOT) might simultaneously be the worst according to Sufficiency (SUFF) [30]. This inconsistency underscores a deep methodological divergence in how "faithfulness" is conceptualized and measured across different metrics. The evaluation of natural language explanations presents additional difficulties, as current quantitative metrics "cannot be directly applied" due to their indirect relationship with model inputs, and tests like counterfactuals struggle to fairly evaluate faithfulness when new linguistic variants are generated [30]. Even the effectiveness of attention weights as explanations remains a widely debated topic, partly attributable to the "lack of well-established evaluation criteria" for attention-based explanations [30]. While efforts like ROSCOE and WHOOPS! exist to evaluate reasoning and explanation generation, the field still contends with significant gaps in achieving user-friendly interpretability and robust evaluation for these complex models [24].

The general scarcity of tailored benchmarks further compounds evaluation difficulties. The absence of domain-specific benchmarks is a "potential challenge for evaluating the clinical effectiveness of LLMs," as highlighted by the need for a "novel benchmark framework" specifically for medical domains like osteoarthritis [20]. This implies that general evaluation metrics and benchmarks are insufficient for specialized contexts. Similarly, evaluating the explainability of LLM security faces challenges, as real-world adversarial attacks evolve rapidly and may not be adequately captured by existing synthetic benchmarks, posing a problem for comprehensive and representative evaluation standards [18]. For prompting-based models, the methods for evaluating explanations are still in their nascent stages, requiring substantial further research [10].

Compounding these issues, the limitations of traditional human evaluation have come under increasing scrutiny. Human evaluation is often characterized as "unstable and irreproducible," plagued by "inconsistent quality," and is "time-consuming, costly and would not be scalable" [21,29]. This critique echoes broader concerns about traditional peer review's "subjective, and inefficient" nature [9]. In response, LLM-based evaluators have emerged as a promising alternative, offering greater potential for reproducibility by explicitly stating the model, random seed, and generation hyperparameters [21]. However, these LLM evaluators introduce their own set of challenges, including "positional bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, limited mathematical and reasoning capabilities, and issues with LLM success at assigning numerical scores" [29]. Moreover, the frequent updates by LLM providers can undermine reproducibility if older models become inaccessible, and different LLMs exhibit distinct scoring tendencies (e.g., text-davinci-003 often gives higher scores, while ChatGPT is stricter) [21]. While relative ranking of texts may remain consistent, absolute scores often vary, suggesting that LLM evaluation's consistency lies more in relative preferences than absolute judgments [21]. This fundamentally underscores the need for rigorous new standards not just for LLM explainability, but also for evaluating the LLM evaluators themselves. Ultimately, despite these advancements, human users remain crucial for critically assessing LLM outputs, particularly because LLMs may prioritize plausibility over accuracy, requiring external validation to ascertain reliability [19,28].
### 4.6 Faithfulness vs. Plausibility of Explanations
A critical challenge in the explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is the inherent tension between the *faithfulness* and *plausibility* of their explanations [15]. Faithfulness refers to the degree to which an explanation accurately reflects the model's actual internal reasoning process, including the causal or influential factors underpinning its decisions [15]. Conversely, plausibility concerns whether an explanation appears intuitive, reasonable, or convincing to a human user, irrespective of its technical accuracy [15]. While high plausibility can foster user trust, it risks overreliance if misaligned with the model's true logic, potentially leading to overtrust and misinterpretation [15,31].

A central critique posits that LLMs "cannot explain themselves" in a truly faithful manner [7]. Their generated "explanations" are often merely "plausible-sounding textual outputs" that do not accurately reflect the underlying mechanical processes [7]. These exogenous narratives, termed "exoplanations," serve to promote critical thinking but do not offer genuine insights into the model's internal workings [7]. This fundamental disconnect stems from LLMs being primarily trained to produce outputs perceived as correct or grammatically sound by human editors, often prioritizing plausibility over faithful internal reasoning or factual accuracy [28]. Consequently, a "critical mismatch between plausible explanations and the faithful behavior of the underlying models" has been identified, where faithful explanations are crucial for technical validation and auditing, but are often at odds with human-oriented plausibility [15].

The widely adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm exemplifies this tension. While CoT can enhance task performance by generating intermediate steps, research indicates that these explanations "can be systematically unfaithful" and "do not always faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning" [12,24,30]. Experiments have shown that even when systematic biases are introduced into prompts—for instance, by reordering multiple-choice options—LLMs like GPT-3.5 and Claude 1.0 "fail to acknowledge the impact of these biased features" in their explanations, indicating a divergence from the true decision-making process [24,30]. Furthermore, some studies suggest that "smaller models tend to produce more faithful explanations compared to larger, more capable models" in certain contexts [30], and newer LLMs may refuse predictions for deliberately manipulated CoT chains, implying CoT text is not a faithful explanation of their true reasoning [8]. This highlights that even seemingly plausible, step-by-step reasoning sequences might not be "entirely correct or reasonable" as reflections of the model's true internal state [3,22].

The divergence between faithfulness and plausibility is particularly salient when LLMs operate as evaluators. Explanations provided by LLMs for scores or assessments are frequently perceived as "reasonable" or plausible by human experts [21]. However, as observed in a case where a human teacher disagreed with ChatGPT's grammatical assessment due to differing interpretations of punctuation errors, the LLM's underlying "reasoning" or criteria may not be "faithful" to nuanced human judgment or objective standards [21]. This indicates that even when LLMs provide detailed, evidence-citing explanations, their internal criteria might diverge from human expectations, embodying programmed biases or subjective interpretations of guidelines [7,21].

To mitigate this challenge, various approaches are being explored. A significant shift involves moving away from *post-hoc* explanations, which are often criticized for being "unfaithful" and not accurately reflecting a black-box model's decision-making [16,17]. Instead, frameworks like Aug-imodel emphasize intrinsic interpretability, ensuring "complete inspection of a model’s decision-making process" through "exact" coefficients that are considerably more faithful than post-hoc methods like LIME and SHAP [16]. Similarly, the SoS-ML framework advocates for "evidence-based explanations" derived directly from a system's internal representations, thereby enhancing faithfulness through intrinsic design [17].

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is another strategy aiming to improve faithfulness by grounding LLM outputs in verifiable "clinical evidence" and enabling the model to "identify the source on which the generated answer was based" [20]. For RAG, faithfulness is quantified by measuring the "factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context," penalizing claims not deducible from the source [29]. However, a limitation of RAG is that retrieval based on semantic similarity can be uncertain, potentially missing key information or retrieving only a portion of relevant data. This can lead to the generation of plausible-sounding but incorrect answers, such as an imprecise recommendation for walking aids in OA treatment, where the explanation is not entirely faithful to the complete underlying evidence [20]. The issue of "plausible false assertions" or "hallucinations"—texts that appear credible but are factually incorrect—further underscores the problem of unfaithfulness in LLM-generated content [9,30,34].

Ultimately, the goal is to bridge the gap between superficial explanations and genuine model understanding, moving beyond merely generating plausible-sounding narratives to ensure explanations accurately reflect actual model behavior and are meaningfully interpretable for human users [2,6]. This necessitates ensuring "explanation accuracy" and "explanation reliability" [32] and recognizing that improving the accuracy of model predictions fundamentally requires LLMs to generate reliable explanations, which remains a significant challenge [30]. Current XAI approaches, if insufficiently robust, can produce misleading or simplistic explanations that engender a false sense of trust in AI reliability [31]. Therefore, embracing "falsifiability" in explanations is crucial for verifiable and accurate reflections of model behavior [14].
### 4.7 Trade-offs: Accuracy, Interpretability, and Scalability
The development and deployment of explainable AI (XAI) for Large Language Models (LLMs) are profoundly shaped by persistent trade-offs among model accuracy, interpretability, and system scalability. This tripartite tension represents a generic and prominent key challenge in the field, further exacerbated by the inherent scale and complexity of LLMs, which introduces unique challenges for achieving transparency [15,31].

A central and often discussed trade-off is that between model accuracy and interpretability. Highly accurate, complex models, such as deep neural networks and LLMs, frequently operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to discern their internal reasoning [17,31]. This often leads to a scenario where higher accuracy comes at the cost of transparency [17]. For instance, while LLM research often prioritizes task enhancement, explainability might only emerge as a byproduct, highlighting a divergence where performance pursuit can overshadow the understanding of underlying mechanisms [24]. Specific experimental results underscore this tension: in the context of LLM-generated explanations, an improvement in perceived fidelity can come "at the cost of the perceived interpretability of the explanation" [4]. Moreover, studies aiming to enhance interpretability often reveal a tangible drop in accuracy; for example, Aug-Linear, an interpretable model augmented by LLMs, lags "4%–6% accuracy" behind a fine-tuned BERT model, a trade-off deemed "reasonable" in settings where interpretability and efficiency are critical [16]. Conversely, inherently explainable models, while offering greater transparency, may struggle with scalability and predictive power compared to their opaque counterparts [15].

The enormous scale and complexity of LLMs introduce significant scalability challenges, impacting both their development and the generation of explanations. Training and operating LLMs, which often involve "billions of parameters" and "trillions of tokens," are "very expensive to train and operate," demanding substantial computational resources and incurring high financial costs [28,33,34]. The environmental impact, including CO2 emissions and resource consumption, further highlights this scalability concern [28]. When it comes to XAI, generating explanations for these massive models also requires "significant computational resources" and can be "prohibitively high" [22,30]. Traditional explanation methods, such as gradient-based approaches and SHAP values, often require "substantial computational power," rendering them "less practical for real-world applications" due to "computational overhead" and real-time requirements [30,32]. The training and serving phases of LLMs face "huge parameter scale" issues, leading to "significant challenges to computation and memory," and requiring complex strategies like checkpointing and parallel computing, which themselves introduce trade-offs in computation, memory, and communication overhead [23]. The tension between audibility through "deep causal traces" and "operational latency" in real-time applications, such as jailbreak detection, further exemplifies the scalability challenge for explainability in critical systems [15].

Interestingly, LLMs themselves introduce a new dimension to these trade-offs when employed as evaluators, particularly in practical applications like automated assessment. LLM-based evaluators offer distinct advantages in scalability and efficiency, being "significantly cheaper and faster" than human evaluators. For instance, rating 200 stories cost "$140 and over a week for human teachers," compared to "less than $5 and a few hours" for an InstructGPT model [21]. These evaluators also provide higher reproducibility and process samples independently, minimizing human exposure to harmful content [21]. Moreover, they can offer a degree of interpretability through generated justifications [29]. This scalability is also leveraged in applications like research peer review, where LLMs can "eliminate months-long delays" and perform "exhaustive, time-consuming analytical work" that frees human experts for high-level synthesis, leading to "faster, more consistent, and ultimately more insightful" systems [9]. However, these benefits are not without limitations. LLM evaluators still exhibit potential factual inaccuracies, behavioral biases (e.g., safety training leading to positive responses), and an inability to process visual cues or genuine emotion, which can affect the accuracy and validity of their assessments in certain domains [21]. Semantic similarity metrics, while "simple, fast, and inexpensive," also suffer from a "lack of interpretability" and "poor correlation with human evaluators," indicating that computational efficiency can come at the cost of interpretability and human alignment [29].

Researchers are actively exploring strategies to mitigate these trade-offs. Techniques like targeted fine-tuning, as demonstrated by NeuroBreak, can achieve security improvements comparable to full fine-tuning while "preserving model utility (e.g., utility scores remain at 0.61 for NeuroBreak vs. 0.58 for Full fine-tuning)" by updating less than 0.2% of parameters, showcasing an efficient approach to navigating utility-safety trade-offs [18]. Visual analytics also aid scalability by enabling multi-granular analysis, allowing experts to delve from macroscopic behavior to neuron-level mechanisms without being overwhelmed by the LLM's scale [18]. The integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and instructional prompts in systems like DocOA can "substantially improve the domain-specific capabilities and explainability of general-purpose LLMs without additional training," achieving high accuracy (e.g., 0.92 in GIQA) in a cost-effective manner, suggesting that tailored approaches can yield positive relationships between accuracy and explainability rather than strict trade-offs [20]. Furthermore, a dynamic trade-off management strategy involves a two-step procedure: utilizing interpretable models like Aug-Linear for samples with "high confidence" to achieve "1000x speed/memory improvement" and "1000x reduction in model size" over LLMs, while relegating "difficult samples" to black-box models. This allows a "large percentage of samples" (e.g., 50%) to be processed with "little to no drop in accuracy" (average drop of 0.0053), balancing efficiency, interpretability, and overall performance [16]. Lightweight explanation mechanisms, optimized computation processes, and incremental/streaming explanations are also proposed to balance interpretability with efficiency and scalability [32]. Despite these advances, the tension between desired properties such as scalability, faithfulness, usability, and institutional alignment remains, with too much transparency potentially increasing exploitability by attackers [15]. The field continues to grapple with these inherent tensions, striving for innovative solutions that can simultaneously enhance performance, interpretability, and scalability in the evolving LLM landscape.
### 4.8 Stakeholder Diversity and Contextual Needs
The efficacy of explainable AI (XAI) for Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges critically on its ability to support "appropriate human understanding," which is inherently sought by "different stakeholders with different goals in different contexts" [2,31]. This fundamental principle necessitates a departure from generic, one-size-fits-all explanations towards highly contextualized and personalized approaches. The field acknowledges that explanations are not monolithic, varying significantly based on the stakeholder's role, background, and specific informational needs [15,17].

Diverse stakeholders possess distinct requirements for LLM explanations. **End-users**, for instance, require explanations that "elucidate the mechanisms behind reasoning model predictions" to "establish appropriate trust, without technical expertise" [30]. Their primary need is to "understand LLM functions, limits, and potential defects," often demanding explanations delivered in an approachable language or style [28,30]. In contrast, **researchers and developers** seek explanations for more technical purposes, such as "debugging," "identifying unexpected biases, risks, and areas needing performance improvement," and ultimately for "developing reliable, ethical, and safe models" [30]. **Regulators and auditors** typically demand compliance justification logs, requiring explanations to be structured in a way that facilitates accountability and oversight [15]. **Domain experts**, such as medical professionals or AI security experts, require explanations that are sensitive to "domain-specific knowledge" and terminology, enabling them to validate findings or analyze complex mechanisms across different levels of detail [11,18,20,30]. The challenge is further exacerbated when experts without a machine learning background struggle to comprehend the intricate decision logic of complex AI systems, underscoring the need for domain adaptation and precise conversion of specialized terminology [11].

The critical importance of contextual relevance and personalization is evident in various applications. Generic LLM outputs, derived from broad web-scale training data, often "miss the domain-specific knowledge" [30,33] and can be perceived as impersonal [33], rendering them less relevant for specific users or contexts. To address this, systems like DocOA are explicitly designed to cater to "patient queries and doctor queries differently," providing final outputs "tailored to the user... in the corresponding style" [20]. Similarly, the LLM Triumvirate framework offers "three distinct analytical viewpoints" (Guardian, Synthesizer, Innovator) to meet the diverse needs of an Associate Editor evaluating academic papers from multiple critical angles [9]. This personalization extends to recognizing varied linguistic needs, with LLMs capable of providing answers in "multiple languages" [28]. The emphasis on "personalized explanations" tailored to "user backgrounds and needs" with evaluation criteria including "target user understanding" and "user satisfaction" further highlights this trend [32].

A significant challenge arises when aligning AI-generated explanations with human understanding, even among experts. As highlighted by research, human evaluators, such as English teachers, exhibit "subjective differences in their interpretation and application of evaluation criteria" [21]. While LLMs can provide detailed explanations, these explanations may stem from an internal logic that does not perfectly align with every human expert's nuanced understanding, leading to "discrepancies in criteria interpretation" [21]. This indicates a broader issue where current LLM explanations can "mislead humans into forming incorrect mental models," suggesting that they are not yet adequately tailored to diverse human cognitive needs or specific contexts [30]. This underlines that the focus should be on how well an explanation facilitates "appropriate human understanding" [2,24].

To overcome these challenges, frameworks and strategies are being developed to provide a "role-sensitive foundation" for explanations. The TAXAL framework, for example, posits that explainability "varied by stakeholder role," advocating for tailoring the content, modality, timing, and presentation format of explanations according to the "context of use" and audience [15]. It proposes "layered explanation strategies" and "explanation role routing" to dynamically adapt granularity based on user profiles, providing, for instance, compliance justification logs for regulators and accessible summaries for consumers [15]. The SoS-ML framework similarly emphasizes that explanations are "contextual social constructs" and introduces concepts like Functional Interpretability (fXAI), context-awareness via System Agents, and an "Evidence-Inference Pair" structure to align with human reasoning [17]. It further suggests "Targeted Explanation Logs" with distinct information for end-users, developers, and other interested parties, translated into natural language by an LLM [17].

The ongoing discourse calls for a "human-centered XAI" approach that acknowledges "who opens matters just as much, if not more, as the ways of opening it" [6]. This requires "broader perspectives and collaborative efforts" and "interdisciplinary cooperation" among experts and stakeholders to develop context-aware explanations [14]. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in business processes, their explanations must be "situation-aware" and "human-interpretable" for specific user groups [4]. Looking forward, the emphasis is on developing "Usable XAI" strategies that bridge the gap between AI automation and diverse human needs [8], necessitating careful design and "appropriate guardrails and responses" when LLMs generate explanations to prevent misinterpretation and promote critical thinking [7].
## 5. Taxonomy and Techniques for LLM Explainability
The rapid evolution and widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse domains necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and decision-making processes. This section establishes a foundational theoretical framework for categorizing and analyzing explainability techniques for LLMs, moving beyond mere output descriptions to foster trust, enable robust auditing, and ensure accountability [15,31]. Given the increasing scale and intrinsic complexity of LLMs, coupled with their emergent behaviors, a structured approach to explainability (XAI) is critical for deciphering their opacity and translating their intricate operations into human-understandable terms [10,30].



![Foundational Axes for LLM Explainability Taxonomy](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/DWaE0y_vC2Wctb2qqbrbO_Foundational%20Axes%20for%20LLM%20Explainability%20Taxonomy.png)

This survey organizes LLM explainability techniques along several foundational axes, recognizing that the optimal choice of method often depends on the model's training paradigm, architectural design, desired scope of explanation, and the context of its application. A primary distinction arises from the LLM's **training paradigm**, differentiating techniques applicable to "traditional fine-tuning models" (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) from those designed for "prompting-based super-large models" (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA) [10,30]. Correspondingly, explainability methods are classified by their **applicability and implementation**, including "model-specific" methods that exploit internal architecture for faithful insights, and "model-agnostic" methods that treat the LLM as a black box, inferring explanations from input-output behavior [15,31].

Further refinement in classification addresses the **timing of explanation generation**—"post-hoc" methods, which analyze model behavior retrospectively, versus "intrinsic" (or ante-hoc) methods, where transparency is built directly into the model's architecture [11,15]. The **scope of explanation** distinguishes between "local explanations," which provide insights into individual predictions, and "global explanations," which aim for a comprehensive understanding of the model's overall learned knowledge or general behavior patterns [10,31]. Additionally, the **architectural design** of LLMs (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) profoundly influences the choice and effectiveness of techniques, necessitating tailored interpretative strategies [26,27].

Building upon these foundational taxonomies, the landscape of LLM explainability encompasses a diverse array of techniques tailored to specific operational paradigms and objectives. For **traditional fine-tuning models**, explainability focuses on deciphering general language understanding capabilities and how fine-tuning enables task-specific performance [25]. This includes **local explanation methods** such as feature attribution (e.g., SHAP, LIME), attention-based explanations, example-based explanations (e.g., counterfactuals), and natural language explanations, which elucidate individual predictions [13,25,30]. Concurrently, **global explanation methods** such as probing techniques, neuron activation analysis, concept-based explanations (e.g., TCAV, CBMs), and mechanistic interpretability (dissecting neural circuits) provide a macroscopic understanding of the model's overall knowledge and behavior [12,25,30].

For **prompting-based models**, the focus shifts to understanding emergent capabilities like In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [25,30]. Explainability efforts here involve unraveling ICL mechanisms, scrutinizing the fidelity of CoT explanations (which can be systematically unfaithful [12,30]), and applying representation engineering to manipulate internal states for desired behaviors like safety alignment [25,30]. For **assistant models** (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT), explainability is paramount for fostering trust in sensitive applications. Key areas include explaining the impact of alignment/fine-tuning (e.g., RLHF), explaining and mitigating hallucinations (addressing dataset issues and model-inherent limitations), and robust uncertainty quantification to assess prediction reliability [25,30].

A critical advancement in the field involves **integrated and causal explanation approaches**, recognizing that true understanding requires moving beyond superficial correlations to identify underlying causal mechanisms [11,17]. This framework synergistically combines various modalities: advanced attribution-based explanations (e.g., Black-box Resampling for CoT [3]), internal module explanations (scrutinizing attention mechanisms and Feed-Forward Networks as "key-value memories" [22]), sample-based explanations (e.g., Influence Functions, counterfactuals), and fine-grained causal interventions (e.g., Causal Attention Suppression [3], NeuroBreak's "Break the Neurons" function [18]). Furthermore, explainable prompting techniques (e.g., CoT, persona-based prompts) and methods for decomposing complex reasoning pathways (e.g., "Thought Anchors" for identifying critical steps [3]) are integral to achieving transparent and verifiable reasoning.

Beyond technical methodologies, **explainable Human-AI system design and frameworks** emphasize embedding transparency directly into the architecture and interaction mechanisms. This involves designing LLM agents with distinct personas for tailored explanations (e.g., Guardian, Synthesizer, Innovator in peer review [9]), generating structured outputs for enhanced clarity and audibility (e.g., hierarchical explanation logs for different stakeholders [17]), and implementing hybrid Human-AI collaboration models where human expertise and judgment are integrated into the AI workflow [17,19].

Finally, the deployment of LLMs in **domain-specific expert systems** (e.g., clinical, finance) necessitates tailored architectures and rigorous benchmarking. Strategies include specialized prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-based reasoning, and Knowledge Graph (KG) integration for structured domain knowledge [8,20,24]. Domain-specific benchmarking employs specialized datasets and metrics (e.g., WHOOPS!, SCIENCEQA, ROSCOE, MATH) and critically integrates human experts for validation to meet stringent requirements for trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance [18,20,34].

Despite significant progress, challenges persist in ensuring the faithfulness and reliability of explanations, developing robust evaluation criteria, achieving scalability for intrinsic interpretability, and bridging the gap between statistical correlations and genuine causal understanding. Future research will likely focus on developing advanced hybrid methodologies that integrate white-box causal analysis with black-box behavioral testing, establishing standardized, human-centered benchmarks for varied contexts, and fostering deeper interdisciplinary collaborations to ensure that LLM explainability evolves in alignment with human values and practical needs.
### 5.1 Categorization of Explainability Techniques (General Principles)
The pursuit of explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a structured classification of techniques to effectively understand, evaluate, and develop transparent AI systems. This section lays the foundational theoretical framework for categorizing XAI methods, serving as a narrative bedrock for the more detailed discussions in subsequent sub-sections. Drawing upon a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we establish a multi-dimensional classification scheme designed to clarify the diverse approaches to LLM explainability [15,31].

A primary distinction in LLM explainability techniques arises from the model's training paradigm, recognizing the fundamental differences between "traditional fine-tuning models" and "prompting-based super-large models" [10,22]. This dichotomy is crucial because the internal mechanisms and operational dynamics of adapting models to specific tasks vary significantly between these paradigms, thereby requiring distinct interpretative strategies. Techniques designed for fine-tuned models often leverage gradients and internal activations, while those for prompting-based models frequently focus on input perturbation or generated rationales.

Beyond the training paradigm, explainability methods are also categorized by their scope, distinguishing between "local explanations" and "global explanations" [10,31]. Local explanations provide insights into how an LLM arrives at a specific prediction for an individual input instance, elucidating particular decision-making paths. Conversely, global explanations aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the model's overall learned knowledge, general behavior patterns, or the function of its core components across the entire dataset. Both scopes are vital for a holistic understanding of LLM behavior, addressing different user needs and trust requirements.

Furthermore, XAI techniques can be classified based on their applicability and implementation, which includes "model-specific," "model-agnostic," and "hybrid approaches" [15,31]. Model-specific methods exploit the internal architecture and parameters of a particular LLM to generate explanations, offering deep and faithful insights but often lacking generalizability. In contrast, model-agnostic methods treat the LLM as a black box, inferring explanations solely from its input-output behavior, thereby providing broad applicability across various models, including proprietary ones, albeit potentially with less fidelity to the model's true internal workings. Hybrid approaches seek to combine the strengths of both by integrating aspects of model-specific analysis with the flexibility of model-agnostic techniques.

An equally critical dimension for classifying explainability is the timing of explanation generation: "post-hoc" versus "intrinsic" (or ante-hoc) methods [11,15]. Post-hoc methods generate explanations after a model has made a prediction, analyzing its behavior retrospectively. While widely adopted due to their flexibility, they can face challenges regarding faithfulness to the model's actual decision process. Intrinsic methods, conversely, involve designing models to be transparent by nature, with explanation mechanisms built directly into their architecture during development, aiming for inherent interpretability and greater trustworthiness. The distinction between "interpretability" (transparency of model mechanics) and "explainability" (post-hoc justifications) further refines this understanding [17].

These foundational classification axes — encompassing LLM training paradigm, explanation scope, approach type, and timing of explanation generation — are not mutually exclusive but rather interconnected, influencing the design choices and trade-offs in terms of faithfulness, scalability, usability, and institutional alignment [15]. The subsequent sections will delve into each of these categories with specific examples, detailed analyses, and a critical appraisal of their strengths, weaknesses, and unique contributions, thereby providing a comprehensive survey of the current landscape of explainability for LLMs. This structured approach facilitates the identification of research gaps and promising future directions, particularly towards integrated and hybrid methodologies that can reconcile the desire for deep insights with the need for broad applicability and user-centered clarity.
#### 5.1.1 General XAI Paradigms (Model-Agnostic vs. Model-Specific, Post-Hoc vs. Intrinsic, Local vs. Global)

**General XAI Paradigms for LLMs**

| Paradigm            | Characteristics                                                          | Strengths                                                        | Weaknesses/Challenges                                       |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model-Agnostic**  | Treats model as "black box," infers explanation from input-output.       | Versatile, applicable to any model (incl. proprietary LLMs).     | Potential lack of faithfulness, less deep insight.          |
| **Model-Specific**  | Exploits internal architecture and parameters of a particular model.     | Deeper, more faithful insights into reasoning.                   | Restricted applicability, less generalizable.               |
| **Post-hoc**        | Generates explanations *after* model training and prediction.            | Flexible, widely applicable to existing models.                  | Risk of unfaithfulness, less causal insight.                |
| **Intrinsic (Ante-hoc)** | Interpretability built into model design *from inception*.             | Greater faithfulness, inherent transparency, direct causal understanding. | Often trade-off with scalability/predictive power, model redesign required. |
| **Local**           | Focuses on explaining a *single prediction* for an instance.             | Debugging specific decisions, enhancing individual trust.        | Can miss overall patterns, less insight into general behavior. |
| **Global**          | Explains overall model behavior, knowledge, or internal workings.        | Auditability, fairness, understanding general patterns.          | Can obscure local nuances, hard for complex models.         |

The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is fundamentally structured around several core paradigms that dictate the approach, scope, and applicability of explanation methods. These paradigms, namely model-agnostic versus model-specific, post-hoc versus intrinsic, and local versus global explanations, provide a foundational framework for understanding and classifying the diverse methodologies employed in rendering Large Language Models (LLMs) interpretable [15,17,32]. Synthesizing these distinctions is crucial for evaluating the design, utility, and trustworthiness of generated explanations [31].

**Model-Agnostic vs. Model-Specific Explanations**:
This dichotomy distinguishes whether an XAI method is universally applicable to any black-box model or specifically tailored to exploit the internal architecture of a particular model type [15,17,31].
*   **Model-Agnostic methods** treat the target model as a "black box," inferring explanations solely from its input-output behavior without delving into its internal workings [15,17]. This makes them highly versatile and critical for explaining complex, proprietary LLMs whose internal mechanisms are not publicly accessible [17]. Prominent examples include SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [15,17,30,31]. For instance, SHAP analysis has been effectively employed to provide insights into feature contributions for predictions made by ML models generated by black-box LLMs like ChatGPT ADA [19]. Other model-agnostic techniques include permutation feature importance [17].
*   **Model-Specific methods**, in contrast, leverage the unique characteristics and internal components of a particular model architecture [15]. For LLMs, this often involves dissecting elements like attention mechanisms, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and specific neurons to understand their functional roles [12,15]. Examples include attention visualization, neuron tracing [15], gradient-based methods, and Grad-CAM [30,31]. Mechanistic interpretability, for instance, is inherently model-specific, focusing on understanding the "biological circuits" within LLMs [12]. NeuroBreak, an approach for analyzing jailbreak mechanisms, represents a model-specific system as it deeply analyzes internal components like layers and individual neurons within a specific LLM [18]. While these methods offer deeper, more faithful insights into a model's reasoning, their applicability is restricted to models with known and exploitable internal structures, potentially limiting their use for proprietary or rapidly evolving LLM architectures.

**Post-Hoc vs. Intrinsic Explanations**:
This distinction relates to the timing and integration of explainability within the model development lifecycle [11,15,32].
*   **Post-hoc methods** generate explanations *after* a model has been trained and made a prediction [11,15,31]. They typically analyze the specific input-output relationship to infer causal contributions or attribute importance [11]. Common examples include LIME, SHAP, and attention heatmaps, which are applied externally to the trained model [15,31]. While widely adopted due to their flexibility, post-hoc explanations often face criticisms regarding their faithfulness to the model's actual decision-making process and may struggle with explaining emergent behaviors of complex LLMs [15,17]. Some research even labels them as "unfaithful" [16]. The AMPLIFY framework, for example, utilizes attribution scores as a post-hoc approach to build natural language rationales for LLMs [24].
*   **Intrinsic (or Ante-hoc) explainability** involves designing models that are transparent by nature, with explanation mechanisms built directly into their architecture during the design and training phases [11,15,17]. This paradigm aims for "complete transparency" by making the model itself capable of explanation [11,16]. Examples include Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), Neural Additive Models (NAMs), and other self-rationalizing architectures [15]. Mechanistic interpretability is inherently intrinsic, focusing on understanding the fundamental components and their roles within the LLM [12]. NeuroBreak is also an intrinsic approach, deeply analyzing internal model components [18]. A notable advancement in LLMs is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the LLM itself generates intermediate reasoning steps, which can be seen as an intrinsic explanation of its decision process [30]. While offering greater faithfulness and trust, intrinsic methods often necessitate a trade-off with scalability and predictive power, as designing inherently transparent complex LLMs remains a significant challenge [15]. Hybrid approaches, combining both intrinsic and post-hoc elements, are emerging to leverage the benefits of both paradigms [15]. The SoS-ML framework further advocates for moving beyond this strict dichotomy, proposing the integration of interpretability and explainability from the ground up through modular, context-aware AI systems [17].

**Local vs. Global Explanations**:
This distinction defines the scope of the explanation, whether it pertains to a single prediction or the overall model behavior [1,15,22,32].
*   **Local explanations** focus on interpreting the prediction for an individual input instance or sample, elucidating how the LLM arrived at a specific decision for that particular input [1,15,22,30]. This is particularly valuable in high-stakes applications where justification for specific decisions is paramount [17]. Examples include token saliency, attention rollout, LIME, SHAP, and counterfactual explanations [15,17,30,31]. Aug-imodels, for instance, provide local explanations through scores for each ngram in a single input [16].
*   **Global explanations**, conversely, aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the LLM's overall operations, learned knowledge, and general behavior patterns across the entire dataset [1,15,22,30]. These methods offer insights into the general principles and internal mechanisms that govern the model's performance [30]. Examples include probing classifiers, representation clustering, circuit tracing [15], Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots, and visualizing decision trees or inspecting fitted coefficients (as seen in Aug-imodels) [16,17]. NeuroBreak exemplifies a multi-granular system that incorporates both global (e.g., layer-wise probing of semantic distributions) and local (e.g., neuron-level attribution) aspects of explainability [18]. The balance between local and global explanations is often critical, as understanding both specific decisions and general behaviors contributes to a holistic understanding of LLM functionality [22,30].

These fundamental XAI paradigms significantly influence the design and evaluation of interpretability methods for LLMs. Model-agnostic and post-hoc approaches offer flexibility for opaque models, but may sacrifice faithfulness, whereas model-specific and intrinsic methods provide deeper, more reliable insights at the cost of broader applicability or model complexity. The choice between local and global explanations depends on the specific user need, whether it's understanding a single decision or grasping the model's overall learned intelligence. Future research trajectories may increasingly focus on hybrid strategies and frameworks like SoS-ML that integrate these paradigms, striving for both comprehensive and faithful explanations across various scales and applications [15,17].
#### 5.1.2 Architectural Classification of Explainability Techniques (Encoder-only, Decoder-only, Encoder-Decoder)
The architectural design of Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly based on the Transformer architecture, profoundly influences the choice and effectiveness of explainability techniques. A nuanced understanding of these architectural distinctions—encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder—is crucial for developing targeted and insightful XAI methods [1,25,26,27]. While many studies broadly acknowledge the Transformer's role in LLM explainability [1,25,26,32], a dedicated classification of XAI methods based on these architectural types is essential for addressing their specific interpretability challenges [27].

**Encoder-only Models:**
These models, exemplified by BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa, are primarily employed in traditional fine-tuning paradigms for tasks like classification and sequence labeling [30]. Their core design emphasizes understanding and encoding bidirectional context from the input sequence. Explainability for encoder-only models largely focuses on dissecting their pre-training and fine-tuning processes to understand how they derive representations and make predictions [30]. Methods often involve analyzing the contribution of input tokens to the final output, understanding attention mechanisms, and identifying critical neurons or layers. For instance, visualization tools for BERT provide insights from individual neurons to entire model layers, aiding in bias detection, attention head localization, and linking neuronal activity to model behavior [24]. Furthermore, techniques like extracting knowledge graphs at different training stages have been proposed to explain knowledge acquisition and language skills in BERT-based models, offering a view into their evolving understanding [24]. The strength of XAI for encoder-only models lies in its ability to pinpoint feature importance and contextual understanding, making them effective for attribution-based explanations. However, their weakness can be in explaining complex multi-step reasoning often exhibited by generative models.

**Decoder-only Models:**
Models such as GPT-3, OPT, LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2, and Falcon represent the decoder-only architecture, predominantly used in the prompting paradigm for text generation and emergent capabilities like few-shot learning [30]. Explainability for these models centers on understanding their autoregressive generation process, how they respond to prompts, and the underlying mechanisms of their emergent behaviors [30]. For GPT-2, visualization tools similar to those for BERT have been used to inspect neuron and layer activities [24]. More specialized techniques include counterfactual generators like Polyjuice, which is fine-tuned on GPT-2 to create diverse, realistic perturbations, helping to understand how input changes affect output [24]. Mechanistic interpretability approaches, such as circuit analysis and reverse engineering applied to GPT-2 small, have been instrumental in identifying specific attention heads responsible for tasks like indirect object identification, revealing complex internal computations [24]. For larger decoder-only models like Alpaca (7B parameters), methods such as Boundless DAS have identified interpretable causal structures for numerical reasoning, demonstrating their ability to solve problems using simple algorithms with interpretable boolean variables [24]. The strength of XAI for decoder-only models lies in its capacity to illuminate generative processes and emergent intelligence, but its complexity arises from the vast parameter space and the intricate, often implicit, prompt interactions.

**Encoder-Decoder Models:**
The original Transformer architecture, consisting of both encoder and decoder blocks, is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation and summarization. Examples include models utilizing a chain of Transformers for encoding and a pre-trained language model for decoding, as seen in mT5 and ByT5, where the encoder depth can significantly vary from the decoder [33,34]. While the fundamental architectural components like MLPs and attention mechanisms are universal targets for interpretability across Transformer-based LLMs [12,18], there is a notable gap in explicitly detailed explanation techniques specific to encoder-decoder architectures within the reviewed literature [30,34]. This limitation suggests that existing XAI research often either adapts general Transformer interpretability methods or primarily focuses on the more prevalent encoder-only (for understanding) and decoder-only (for generation) paradigms. Explainability for these models would ideally bridge the understanding of how the input is encoded, how this encoding is then attended to by the decoder, and how the output sequence is generated based on this cross-attention. The unique challenge lies in explaining the complex transformation process across the encoder-decoder boundary, which involves two distinct yet interacting information flows.

**Comparison, Contrast, and Future Directions:**
While all three architectures share common underlying Transformer components (attention, FFNs, MLPs) that are amenable to general interpretability techniques [12,18], their distinct design principles necessitate different XAI focuses. Encoder-only models excel in tasks requiring deep contextual understanding and benefit from attribution-based methods. Decoder-only models, with their generative capabilities, demand XAI that can unravel emergent behaviors and the impact of prompts on generation. Encoder-decoder models, despite being the foundational Transformer design, appear to have received less specific XAI categorization, indicating a potential area for future research. The strength of applying XAI to encoder-only models is their relative conceptual simplicity in mapping input features to output predictions. For decoder-only models, the strength lies in exploring how prompts elicit specific, often complex, creative outputs. The absence of explicit XAI techniques tailored to encoder-decoder models suggests a weakness in the current research landscape, possibly due to the combined complexity of input encoding and output decoding, or a reliance on adapting techniques from the other two categories.

Future research should prioritize the development of specialized XAI methods for encoder-decoder architectures, focusing on the interplay between encoder and decoder states and the cross-attention mechanisms that facilitate information flow. This could involve quantifying the information transfer between encoder output and decoder input, or analyzing how encoder representations are utilized in generating specific tokens. Furthermore, integrating insights from mechanistic interpretability, which probes the internal "circuits" of LLMs [24], holds promise for all architectural types, moving beyond mere input-output explanations to understanding the internal computational graph. This architectural classification lays the groundwork for a more detailed exploration of specific XAI techniques in subsequent discussions, ensuring that explanations are relevant and effective for the distinct operational mechanisms of each LLM type.
### 5.2 Explainability for Traditional Fine-tuning Models
Explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) trained under the traditional fine-tuning paradigm is a critical area of research, focusing on demystifying the internal workings of models that undergo extensive pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning [1,25,26,30]. This paradigm, exemplified by models such as GPT-2 and BERT, forms a foundational context for understanding LLM behavior [24]. The overarching objectives of explainability within this context are twofold: first, to decipher the general language understanding capabilities acquired during the self-supervised pre-training phase; and second, to analyze how the subsequent fine-tuning process enables effective and specialized performance on specific downstream tasks [25]. Achieving these objectives is paramount for fostering user trust, enhancing model debugging, ensuring responsible AI development, and improving overall model reliability [30,31].

A systematic and comprehensive approach to LLM explainability organizes techniques primarily by their underlying training paradigm (distinguishing traditional fine-tuning from prompt-based methods) and then by their explanatory scope: local versus global [25,30]. 

![XAI Methods for Traditional Fine-tuning Models](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/KGWPeKoNotPwSdvqGnjpH_XAI%20Methods%20for%20Traditional%20Fine-tuning%20Models.png)

This section lays the groundwork by introducing explainability methods applicable to fine-tuned LLMs, emphasizing the distinction between local and global explanations as foundational for subsequent detailed discussions [10,13,22].

**Local Explanation Methods** are designed to elucidate why an LLM made a particular prediction for a single, specific input instance [13,25,30]. These methods delve into the immediate decision-making process for an individual input, providing granular insights into which input features, internal states, or specific examples contributed to a given output. The aim is to make individual predictions comprehensible, thereby enhancing transparency and user trust in specific model actions [31]. This category encompasses diverse techniques such as feature attribution (quantifying input feature importance), attention-based explanations (visualizing internal focus), example-based explanations (showing how predictions change with input variations), and natural language explanations (generating human-readable rationales) [13,25,30]. Despite their utility in diagnostics and fostering trust, common challenges for local explanations include ensuring the faithfulness and robustness of the generated explanations, managing computational complexity (particularly for methods like SHAP), and establishing standardized evaluation benchmarks [15,30,31]. Critically, post-hoc methods like LIME and SHAP, often applied to fine-tuned models, face scrutiny regarding their potential to lose information by summarizing the model or providing unfaithful explanations [16,17].

In contrast, **Global Explanation Methods** offer a macroscopic lens, aiming to understand the LLM's overall internal mechanisms, the general knowledge it acquires, and the linguistic properties it encodes across diverse tasks and data distributions [13,25,30]. These techniques move beyond individual predictions to reveal generalized patterns and the model's behavior as a whole [15,31]. Key methodologies include probing techniques (inferring encoded linguistic information), neuron activation analysis (examining individual neuron functions), concept-based explanations (mapping internal representations to human-understandable concepts), and mechanistic interpretability (dissecting neural circuits to understand causal pathways) [13,25,30]. These methods collectively strive to map complex high-dimensional representations into human-understandable terms, offering insights into *what* information is stored, *where* it resides, and *how* it contributes to the model's overall function [25,30]. Tools like the InterpretableLLM framework and the SoS-ML framework integrate both local and global insights, illustrating the complementary nature of these approaches in providing a holistic understanding of complex AI systems, including those that are traditionally fine-tuned [17,32].

The interplay between local and global explanation methods is crucial for comprehensive understanding. While local explanations provide specific justifications for individual decisions, global explanations offer the context and underlying principles governing the model's general behavior. Challenges often arise from the inherent opacity of deep learning models, where even for fine-tuned architectures, discerning faithful and robust explanations remains complex. Many general XAI methods, such as Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) (global) or LIME and SHAP (local), are broadly applicable to fine-tuned models, but their limitations as post-hoc techniques are consistently highlighted [16,17]. Future directions in explainability for fine-tuned LLMs are expected to move towards methods that are more intrinsically interpretable, where transparency is embedded in the model design rather than added as an afterthought. This includes leveraging LLMs themselves to aid in designing inherently explainable architectures or to generate candidate concepts, thereby enhancing the scalability and practicality of interpretability efforts [11,24]. The ongoing research, as exemplified by applications in fine-tuned safety mechanisms for LLMs, aims to continuously develop more precise, context-aware, and computationally efficient interpretability tools, supported by robust evaluation benchmarks to quantify their practical utility and reliability [18]. The subsequent sub-sections will delve into the specific techniques and advancements within these local and global explanation categories, providing detailed analysis of their methodologies, unique contributions, and associated challenges.
#### 5.2.1 Local Explanation Methods
Local explanation methods represent a critical paradigm within explainable AI, specifically designed to elucidate why a Large Language Model (LLM) made a particular prediction for a given input instance [13,25,30]. Unlike global explanations that aim to comprehend an LLM's overall behavior, local explanations focus intensely on interpreting the prediction of a single input sample, often within the context of traditionally fine-tuned models [1,10,15,22,26]. This granular approach is vital for fostering user trust, enhancing model understanding, and enabling advanced diagnostics by providing specific, actionable insights into individual decisions [11,31]. The theoretical underpinning of local explanations involves bridging the inherent opacity of complex LLM architectures with human-comprehensible rationales, offering varied perspectives on how input features influence an output or how internal mechanisms contribute to a decision [12].



**Types of Local Explanation Methods for LLMs**

| Method Category             | Description                                                              | Key Techniques/Approaches                                   | Insights Provided                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Attribution**     | Quantifies contribution of input features to a specific prediction.      | Perturbation-based (LOO), Gradient-based (IG), Surrogate Models (LIME, SHAP) | Input importance, model sensitivity, feature influence     |
| **Attention-based Expl.**   | Leverages LLM attention mechanisms to highlight input relevance.         | Heatmaps, Graphical Representations, Attention Flow Analysis | Internal focus, information propagation, token dependencies |
| **Example-based Expl.**     | Observes prediction changes due to input variations.                     | Adversarial Examples, Counterfactuals, Data Influence     | Model vulnerabilities, decision boundaries, causal effects |
| **Natural Language Expl.** | Generates human-readable textual rationales for decisions.               | Self-rationalization (CoT), Training on human annotations | Human-understandable reasoning, process articulation       |

Local explanation techniques are broadly categorized into four primary types: feature attribution, attention-based explanations, example-based explanations, and natural language explanations [13,25,30]. Each category employs distinct operational principles and yields different output formats, thereby providing unique insights into LLM behavior [32].

**Feature attribution methods** quantify the contribution of individual input features, such as words or phrases, to a model's specific prediction by assigning relevance scores. These methods, which include perturbation-based, gradient-based, surrogate models like LIME and SHAP, and decomposition techniques, generate score-based outputs to highlight the most critical components of an input. The insights gained reveal precisely which parts of the input are most influential, allowing for direct interrogation of model sensitivity and input feature importance.

**Attention-based explanations** leverage the intrinsic attention mechanisms within Transformer-based LLMs to highlight connections and dependencies between input tokens. Primarily producing visualizations like heatmaps, or augmented scores, these methods intuitively illustrate which parts of the input the model "attends" to during processing. While offering a glimpse into internal information flow, their faithfulness as standalone explanations is a subject of ongoing debate, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation criteria.

**Example-based explanations** probe LLM behavior by observing how predictions change in response to modified input instances. This category encompasses adversarial examples, which expose model vulnerabilities through minimal perturbations, and counterfactual explanations, which identify the smallest input changes required to alter a prediction to a desired outcome. The output format typically consists of modified input examples, providing direct insights into model fragility, biases, and actionable recourse for users. Data influence techniques also fall into this category, examining the impact of training data points on specific predictions.

**Natural language explanations (NLEs)** aim to generate human-readable textual rationales for an LLM's decisions, often through self-rationalization (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) or by training on human-annotated explanations. The output is descriptive text that attempts to articulate the model's reasoning process. While NLEs offer inherently understandable narratives and high cognitive alignment, concerns about their faithfulness and reliability persist, as they may represent post-hoc rationalizations rather than genuine causal reasoning [15,16].

Collectively, these local explanation methods pursue the common goal of enhancing transparency and trust in LLMs by making individual predictions comprehensible. They differ significantly in their approach: some delve into the model's internal mechanics (e.g., feature attribution, attention), while others focus on observable input-output relationships (e.g., example-based) or human-centric narratives (e.g., natural language explanations). A recurring challenge across these diverse methods is ensuring the faithfulness and robustness of the explanations—whether they truly reflect the model's internal decision-making process or merely offer plausible but potentially misleading post-hoc interpretations [16,17]. Furthermore, computational complexity, especially for methods like SHAP [30], and the difficulty of evaluating the quality and accuracy of generated explanations, particularly for natural language outputs, remain significant practical hurdles. Future advancements in local explainability are anticipated to focus on developing methods that offer more faithful, context-aware, and computationally efficient insights, alongside the establishment of robust, standardized evaluation benchmarks to definitively quantify their utility and reliability [15,30,31].
##### 5.2.1.1 Feature Attribution Methods
Feature attribution methods represent a cornerstone in explainable AI, particularly for Large Language Models (LLMs), by quantifying the contribution of individual input features (e.g., words, phrases, or text spans) to a model's specific prediction [10,25,30]. This quantification assigns a relevance score, $G(x)$, to input features, $x$, reflecting their influence on the model's output, $f(x)$ [11,25]. These methods are instrumental in discerning which parts of the input are most critical for a given prediction, thereby fostering user understanding and trust [13,31]. Attribution explanations can also be leveraged for advanced diagnostics, such as evaluating LLM answer quality or detecting hallucinations by identifying passages or input words the model relied upon [8]. For instance, a classifier trained on attribution-extracted passages achieved performance comparable to human annotation in judging answer correctness for machine reading comprehension tasks [8]. Similarly, average attribution scores of part-of-speech words in input instructions proved effective in building hallucination detectors, even when explanations were generated by smaller models (e.g., Vicuna/Mistral-7B) for larger ones (e.g., ChatGPT 3.5) [8]. Feature attribution methods are broadly categorized into four primary types: perturbation-based, gradient-based, surrogate models, and decomposition methods [10,22,25,30].

**Perturbation-based Methods** assess feature importance by systematically disturbing the input—through deletion, masking, or alteration of features—and observing the consequent changes in the model's output [25,30]. A common instantiation is the Leave-one-out (LOO) strategy, which involves removing features at various granularities (e.g., embedding vectors, hidden units, words, tokens, or spans) to quantify their impact. The underlying principle of LOO is to identify the minimal set of input components whose removal significantly alters the model's prediction [30]. A key limitation of perturbation-based methods is their inherent assumption of input feature independence, thereby failing to account for intricate correlations and interdependencies among features [25,30]. Furthermore, these methods can be unreliable when models exhibit overconfidence, even in the presence of meaningless or significantly reduced inputs [30]. A notable challenge is the generation of out-of-distribution data during perturbation, though this can be partially mitigated by constraining perturbations to remain proximate to the original data distribution [30]. In a practical application, perturbation-based attribution, specifically using SNIP scores, has been employed to identify critical neurons in LLMs. The importance score for a neuron $i$ is calculated as $I_i(x) = |w_i \cdot \Delta L(x)|$, where $x=(x_{\text{prompt}}, x_{\text{response}})$ is the input instance and $w_i$ is the neuron’s weight, enabling the localization of safety-critical neurons [18].

**Gradient-based Methods** determine feature importance by analyzing the partial derivatives of the model's output with respect to each input dimension [25,30]. The magnitude of these derivatives serves as an indicator of the output's sensitivity to changes in the corresponding input feature, thus reflecting its importance [30,32]. Basic formulations include raw gradients, $\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}$, and the "Gradient × Input" scheme, $x \odot \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}$, often used for token-level attribution in LLMs [30]. Vanilla gradient methods, however, suffer from several drawbacks: they do not satisfy input invariance (meaning input transformations like constant shifts can produce misleading attributions without affecting predictions), they cannot properly handle zero-value inputs, and they are susceptible to gradient saturation, where large gradients can mask the influence of smaller, yet significant, ones [30]. More broadly, these methods can be sensitive to the model's non-linearities and saturation effects, potentially yielding sparse or unstable explanations [32]. Integrated Gradients (IG) offer an improvement, addressing some of these issues by accumulating gradients along an interpolated path between a chosen reference point and the actual input, thereby satisfying more attribution axioms [30]. Despite its advancements, IG presents its own challenges, such as the ambiguity in selecting an appropriate baseline reference point and the computational overhead associated with achieving high-quality integration [30]. Moreover, IG's integration along a straight path is ill-suited for discrete word embedding spaces, necessitating specialized variants for language models [30]. Practical application involves calculating gradients for a target token in a causal language model by setting `input_ids.requires_grad = True`, performing a forward pass, isolating the `target_logit`, calling `backward()`, and then computing absolute gradients [32]. Beyond direct input-output derivatives, gradient-based association analysis is also applied to uncover inter-neuron collaboration patterns and quantify causal relationships within LLM safety mechanisms [18]. Other gradient-related techniques, such as Grad-CAM and Saliency maps, traditionally used in image classification, can also be adapted for deep learning models, including qualitative and quantitative analysis of how contrastive input-label demonstrations influence LLM's In-Context Learning (ICL) predictions [24,31].

**Surrogate Models** involve training simpler, more interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, linear models) to locally approximate and explain the predictions of complex, black-box models [25,30]. A critical requirement for these explanations is "additivity," meaning the total predictive influence must be decomposable into the sum of individual feature influences [25,30]. The choice of interpretable representation is paramount, balancing explanatory power with human comprehensibility [30].

*   **LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** is an early, prominent local explanation method. It constructs a local surrogate model around a specific instance by sampling perturbed data points to approximate the complex model's behavior within that confined region [30,31]. However, LIME has been shown to not consistently satisfy essential additive attribution properties like local accuracy, consistency, and missingness [30]. Both LIME and SHAP are often model-agnostic and known for their strong causal tracing capabilities, but they frequently assume linear separability and suffer from context sensitivity, particularly problematic in autoregressive LLM architectures [15]. The cognitive clarity of their explanations can also vary depending on user expertise [15].

*   **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is a robust framework grounded in cooperative game theory, which guarantees the satisfaction of desirable additive attribution properties [25,30]. SHAP assigns "Shapley values" to each feature, representing its fair contribution to the prediction, by considering all possible coalitions of features [17,30]. Unlike LIME, SHAP computes these values by considering the entire dataset rather than building a local model for each instance [30]. It offers versatile local and global insights and has seen extensive application, such as in healthcare for explaining patient diagnosis systems [17]. Despite its theoretical appeal, applying SHAP poses practical challenges, including the selection of appropriate methods for feature removal and the significant computational complexity (exponential with the number of features) of exactly estimating Shapley values [30,32]. Various approximation strategies, such as weighted linear regression and permutation tests, are employed to mitigate this computational burden [30]. To adapt SHAP for Transformer-based LLMs, TransSHAP was developed, focusing on subword text inputs and providing sequential visualizations for better understanding of LLM predictions [30]. A notable real-world application includes ChatGPT ADA autonomously performing SHAP analysis in clinical research, identifying critical variables like age and specific genetic variants across diverse medical datasets. The accuracy of these SHAP outputs was further validated by a seasoned data scientist, underscoring its utility for enhancing transparency and trust [19].

*   **Permutation Feature Importance**, originally introduced for random forests, is another model-agnostic technique that quantifies feature relevance by observing the change in model accuracy after shuffling the values of a specific feature [17]. It provides a robust measure of importance, particularly valuable in fields like finance and healthcare for ranking features [17]. However, post-hoc XAI techniques like SHAP and Permutation Feature Importance are generally critiqued for potentially being incomplete, misleading, or misaligned with human cognitive processes, which can reduce their reliability in critical applications [17].

*   In contrast to these post-hoc methods, approaches like **Aug-Linear** inherently provide feature attribution through their fitted coefficients. These coefficients directly represent the "contribution to the prediction" of each ngram and are capable of capturing "strong interactions" between terms [16]. Aug-Linear attributions are described as "exact and therefore avoid summarizing interactions, making them considerably more faithful than post hoc methods, such as LIME and SHAP" [16]. A significant advantage is its ability to automatically infer coefficients for unseen trigrams from LLM embeddings, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities [16]. These attributions facilitate auditing with prior knowledge and exhibit strong correlations with human-labeled sentiment scores (Spearman $\rho = 0.63$ for bigrams, $\rho = 0.71$ for trigrams), outperforming conventional bag-of-words models [16].

**Decomposition Methods**, such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD), aim to linearly decompose relevance scores to attribute importance across the network [10,25]. These techniques propagate relevance scores backward through the network, from the output layer to the input layer, or layer by layer, to quantify the contribution of each input feature [25,32]. While LRP and DTD are recognized within feature attribution, specific details regarding their nuanced application and unique limitations within the context of LLMs are less elaborated in the current literature digests [30].

In summary, feature attribution methods offer diverse approaches to illuminate the black-box nature of LLMs. While methods like perturbation-based and gradient-based approaches directly probe model behavior, surrogate models like SHAP and LIME provide interpretable approximations, albeit with challenges related to computational cost, linear separability assumptions, and context sensitivity. Newer techniques like Aug-Linear promise more faithful and exact attributions, demonstrating a potential shift towards inherently interpretable models or more rigorous post-hoc alternatives. The ongoing development of frameworks such as `Inseq` and `AMPLIFY` further aids in standardizing the extraction and visualization of these importance scores, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy LLM applications [24].
##### 5.2.1.2 Attention-based Explanations
Attention mechanisms are widely regarded as an intuitive avenue for explaining the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) by highlighting the most relevant parts of the input [10,25,30]. The initial intuition posits that these mechanisms capture meaningful correlations between intermediate states, thereby offering insights into how a model processes information and arrives at a decision [11,31]. This intrinsic explainability leverages the attention weights within LLMs to illuminate neural network decision paths [11]. While the Transformer architecture fundamentally relies on self-attention to establish associations and generate contextualized token representations [34], the focus here is specifically on attention as an explainable AI (XAI) technique.

The application of attention mechanisms for interpretability broadly falls into two categories: visualization methods and function-based methods [25,30].

**Visualization Methods**
Visualization techniques provide an intuitive means to understand the internal workings of LLMs by graphically representing attention patterns and statistics [10,25,30]. These methods include:
*   **Attention Heatmaps**: These are a prominent technique for visualizing the distribution of attention weights, illustrating which input tokens or segments the model "looks at" [15,32]. Heatmaps can be used to examine individual attention heads at the neuron level and to visualize attention across heads and layers at the model level, enabling the identification of specific patterns [25,30]. For instance, a Python code snippet example demonstrates the use of `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize attention for specific layers and heads within Hugging Face Transformer models [32].
*   **Graphical Representations**: Beyond heatmaps, methods like bipartite graphs are employed to display attention scores and relationships between input elements [25,30].
*   **Multi-scale Analysis**: Visual systems can display attention relationships across various scales, such as attention scores between sentences, individual attention heads, or aggregated attention across multiple heads and layers [30].
*   **Attention Flow Analysis**: This technique analyzes how attention moves and transforms across different layers and heads of the model, providing insights into information propagation and evolution during processing [30,32].
*   **Self-attention Pattern Analysis**: Identifying patterns in the self-attention mechanisms helps in understanding the internal operational dynamics of the model [32]. More advanced techniques, such as Transformer Circuits theory or projecting model weights onto static word vectors, aim to reveal specific behaviors of these weights [8]. Tools like Vig (2020)'s visualization tool offer insights into attention heads for models like BERT and GPT-2, aiding in bias detection and localizing relevant attention heads. Similarly, Wang et al. (2022) conducted circuit analysis on GPT-2 small to identify roles of specific attention heads in tasks such as recognizing indirect objects, a form of mechanistic interpretability [24].

**Function-based Methods**
Acknowledging that raw attention alone might be insufficient for a complete explanation, function-based methods augment attention weights with additional signals to derive enhanced attribution scores [25,30]. These methods integrate gradients, which are established indicators of sensitivity and saliency, into custom attribution scores [10,25,30]. Specific approaches include computing partial derivatives of attention weights, using integrated versions of partial gradients, or applying element-wise products of gradients and attention scores [30]. These hybrid scores generally demonstrate superior performance compared to either raw attention or raw gradients alone, by effectively fusing more information to highlight important features and elucidate network behavior [30].

**Debate and Limitations on Faithfulness**
Despite the intuitive appeal and wide application of attention-based explanations, an ongoing academic debate exists regarding whether raw attention weights alone constitute faithful explanations [10,13,15,22,32].
A critical limitation is that attention weights primarily capture correlation rather than causal influence; a high attention score does not necessarily imply that a token directly drives the prediction [15,32]. Gradient-based attribution methods (e.g., Grad-CAM) and attention-based attribution (e.g., attention rollout) are useful for debugging and hallucination analysis, but they too often lack clear causality [15].

Critics argue that attention mechanisms may not accurately reflect the most important information for a model's decision, sometimes failing to identify crucial features for prediction when compared to other methods like LIME, resulting in "poorer explanations" or a lack of correlation with alternative explanation methods [13,30]. Furthermore, concerns have been raised that raw attention might not effectively capture syntactic structure and can contain "redundant information," thereby reducing its reliability as a standalone explanation [30].

However, counterarguments exist. Some research highlights challenges in achieving consistent evaluation across different explanation methods and notes potential biases introduced by manipulating attention weights without retraining the model [30]. Other studies have demonstrated that certain BERT attention heads can indeed effectively encode syntactic information [30]. Technical solutions proposed to mitigate these limitations include optimizing input representation, canonicalizing learning objectives, avoiding biased learning, and incorporating human rationales [30]. Fundamentally, a core reason for this persistent debate is identified as the "lack of well-established evaluation criteria" for attention-based explanations [30]. This underscores the need for robust benchmarks and metrics to definitively assess the faithfulness and utility of attention-based interpretability techniques.
##### 5.2.1.3 Example-based Explanations
Example-based explanations constitute a fundamental category of interpretability techniques that elucidate the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically observing how their outputs vary in response to diverse input instances [13,25,30]. This paradigm shifts the analytical focus from internal model mechanisms to the empirical relationship between inputs and outputs, thereby providing insights into an LLM's decision-making process [25]. This approach encompasses several distinct methodologies, including adversarial examples, counterfactual explanations, and data influence techniques, each offering unique perspectives on model vulnerabilities, biases, and sensitivities [25,30].

Adversarial examples are meticulously crafted input instances generated by making minimal, often imperceptible, modifications to the original data, typically targeting less important components [13,30]. The primary objective of these instances is to expose areas where a model exhibits fragility, falters, or makes erroneous predictions, thereby highlighting its inherent weaknesses and sensitivities to small perturbations [13,22,30].

The generation of adversarial examples has evolved significantly. Early methods primarily involved simple word-level operations such as typos, deletions, or insertions [30]. More sophisticated token-level perturbation techniques have since emerged, exemplified by methods like TextFooler [30]. TextFooler strategically targets important words for perturbation based on a multi-criteria approach, considering word ranking, word embedding similarity, part-of-speech (POS) tags, sentence semantic similarity, and prediction shifts [30]. Recent advancements leverage contextual representations, utilizing masked language models (e.g., BERT) for perturbations such as replacement, insertion, and merging, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance [30]. Furthermore, frameworks like SemAttack propose direct manipulation of embeddings across various spaces to generate optimized adversarial perturbations, showcasing a trend towards more abstract and effective attack vectors [30]. These methods collectively allow researchers to probe the boundaries of an LLM's robust performance, revealing how minor changes can lead to significant prediction alterations [22,25].

Counterfactual explanations are a potent form of "what-if" interpretability, designed to reveal what specific input features, when minimally altered, would lead to a different model prediction [11,13,17,22,25,30,31]. This approach directly identifies the smallest changes to an input that would yield a desired alternative outcome, making it invaluable for providing actionable insights [17,30]. For instance, in high-stakes applications such as law and finance, counterfactuals can articulate scenarios like "If your income were higher, your loan would be approved," which aligns closely with human intuitive reasoning and decision-making processes [17]. Moreover, counterfactual explanations are considered causally faithful and are critical for achieving compliance and auditability in regulated domains [15].

The generation of counterfactual examples can involve human input or automated perturbation techniques like paraphrasing or word replacement [30]. Polyjuice stands out as a representative generator, supporting multiple permutation types, including deletion, negation, and shuffling, and employing token importance-based perturbations [30]. Fine-tuned on GPT-2, Polyjuice excels at providing realistic counterfactuals and generates a broader range of such examples more rapidly compared to prior crowd-sourced methods [30]. The InterpretableLLM framework further illustrates advanced counterfactual generation, incorporating gradient-based techniques to produce minimally modified samples, search-based algorithms for specific conditions, and diversified generation for comprehensive explanations, complemented by visualization tools [32]. While the empirical results cited for InterpretableLLM, indicating 88.9% accuracy, 4.2/5 comprehensibility, 92.1% consistency, 4.6/5 completeness, and 87.3% stability, are hypothetical and illustrative, they underscore the potential for such methods to outperform traditional approaches [32]. A notable limitation of counterfactual explanations, despite their causal faithfulness, is the potential difficulty for non-expert users to interpret them effectively [15].

Data influence techniques focus on understanding the impact of individual training data points on an LLM's predictions for test data [13,30]. This category of example-based explanation aims to quantify the extent to which specific training samples contribute to or affect the model's loss at a particular test point [25]. By identifying these influential training examples, researchers can gain insights into potential data biases, highlight crucial training instances, or diagnose issues related to data quality [13]. While the general concept of data influence, including methods like influence functions and Data Shapley, is recognized as a vital component for revealing model sensitivities related to its training corpus, specific detailed methodologies were not extensively elaborated upon in the provided digests for this subsection [25,30]. However, its inclusion within example-based explanations underscores the broader principle of examining external factors (training data) to explain model behavior on specific instances.

In summary, example-based explanations provide a powerful lens through which to understand LLM behavior by manipulating and observing input-output relationships. Adversarial examples primarily serve to identify model vulnerabilities and limitations by seeking out failure cases via minor, often unimportant perturbations. In contrast, counterfactual explanations offer insights into desired outcomes and actionable recourse by identifying minimal, often significant, changes to input features that would alter a prediction. Data influence, while distinct, complements these by revealing the foundational impact of training data on individual predictions. Each method, through its unique approach to input perturbation and observation, contributes to a holistic understanding of LLM decision-making, bridging the gap between model complexity and user trust . Future developments are anticipated to enhance the fidelity, robustness, and user-friendliness of these example-based explanations, particularly for non-expert users.
##### 5.2.1.4 Natural Language Explanations
Natural language explanations (NLEs) are a prominent approach in Large Language Model (LLM) explainability, primarily aimed at generating human-readable textual rationales for an LLM's decisions [11,13,25,30]. The core objective of NLEs is to provide inherently understandable insights into complex model behaviors, thereby enhancing transparency and user trust [11]. This method transforms intricate model outputs into accessible narratives, allowing users to comprehend the rationale behind predictions or actions [11].

The generation of NLEs typically employs several key approaches. A common technique involves training LLMs on a combination of raw input text and human-annotated explanations [10,22,25,30]. This supervised learning paradigm enables the model to learn the patterns and structures of human-generated explanations, subsequently producing its own descriptive accounts of its decision-making process [10,22].

Beyond direct training on human annotations, more advanced methods leverage the intrinsic generative capabilities of LLMs themselves. One significant development is the use of LLMs to generate "self-rationalizations" or "Natural Language Justifications" for their predictions, often termed as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations [15,16,32]. This involves prompting the LLM to articulate its intermediate reasoning steps in a human-readable format, effectively externalizing its internal thought process [32]. For instance, the "推理链解释技术" (Reasoning Chain Explanation Techniques) focuses on extracting these intermediate steps and visualizing reasoning paths, with hypothetical empirical results suggesting high accuracy (92.3%) and comprehensibility (4.0/5) in such explanations [32]. The `AMPLIFY` framework also generates natural language rationales for LLMs by utilizing post-hoc explanation methods like attribution scores, aiming to enhance performance in complex reasoning tasks [24]. Similarly, "Classify by Description" uses LLMs to generate descriptive features for visual categories, offering greater transparency than conventional techniques [24].

Furthermore, NLEs can be tailored to specific contexts and audiences. The `SoS-ML` framework, for example, produces comprehensive explanation logs structured for diverse recipients: an overview for AI end-users, system information for AI developers, and detailed appendices for interested parties, demonstrating a nuanced approach to contextualized explanation delivery [17]. In specialized domains, such as healthcare, DocOA generates evidence-based natural language responses for osteoarthritis management, explicitly identifying the sources of its clinical evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure professional evaluation [20]. For methodological decisions, ChatGPT ADA has demonstrated the capacity to provide plain language explanations, as shown by its rationale for choosing zero-imputation over median imputation in a genetic dataset, highlighting its ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge [19]. LLMs can also explain complex concepts like code, adjusting the level of detail and examples for different users (e.g., "explain as if I am a high school student"), effectively acting as "personal tutors" [28]. The integration of LLMs in frameworks like that for `SAX` explanations further leverages their capacity to synthesize diverse inputs into human-like textual content [4]. Even in academic peer review, LLM personas can generate structured, standardized reviews that serve as human-readable textual explanations, providing specific feedback on various aspects like methodological flaws and novelty [9].

Despite their promise, natural language explanations face significant challenges, particularly concerning reliability and faithfulness. A critical limitation is that LLM-generated explanations, including CoT, often "fail to explain the model as a whole and are again less reliable than having a fully transparent model (e.g., explanations are often unfaithful)" [16]. These self-rationalizations, while offering a low-friction form of explainability, may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than genuine causal reasoning, which severely reduces their faithfulness and reliability in critical applications [15]. While they exhibit high cognitive and functional alignment, their causal faithfulness can be limited [15]. The reliability of these explanations, whether derived from human annotations or self-generation, requires substantial further research [30].

Furthermore, the evaluation of NLEs presents considerable difficulty. Standard quantitative metrics are frequently inapplicable because NLEs rarely maintain a direct, easily quantifiable relationship with the original input or model's internal states [30]. Advanced tests like counterfactual and input reconstruction methods also struggle to provide fair faithfulness evaluations when dealing with the generation of new linguistic variants inherent in natural language explanations [30]. The need for human verification for accuracy, as highlighted in code explanations [28], underscores the ongoing reliance on human oversight to validate the correctness and utility of these explanations. Addressing these limitations in reliability, faithfulness, and evaluation remains a central focus for advancing the utility and trustworthiness of natural language explanations in LLM explainability.
#### 5.2.2 Global Explanation Methods
Global explanation methods are fundamental to demystifying the opaque nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a macroscopic lens to understand their internal mechanisms, the knowledge they acquire, and the linguistic properties they encode [13,25,30]. Unlike local explanations that focus on individual predictions, global explanations aim to reveal generalized patterns, overall internal workings, and the model's behavior across diverse tasks [15,31]. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for building trust, ensuring reliability, and fostering responsible AI development [31]. These techniques typically delve into structural components such as neurons, hidden layers, and larger architectural modules, seeking to uncover the semantic information learned within various network components [10,22].

The theoretical framework for global explanations positions them as a critical bridge between the complexity of LLM architectures and human interpretability. These methods collectively strive to map complex high-dimensional representations and computations into human-understandable terms, offering insights into *what* information is stored, *where* it resides, and *how* it contributes to the model's overall function [25,30]. This encompasses a spectrum of techniques, from inferring latent linguistic properties to dissecting the intricate neural circuits that govern model behavior, providing a "biology" or computational graph of the LLM's internal workings [12].



**Types of Global Explanation Methods for LLMs**

| Method Category              | Description                                                              | Key Techniques/Approaches                                 | Insights Provided                                           |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Probing Techniques**       | Infers linguistic/semantic info encoded in LLM layers.                   | Classifier-based (linear probes), Data-based (special datasets) | Localization of knowledge, specific attribute encoding      |
| **Neuron Activation Analysis** | Examines individual/groups of neurons to understand functional roles.    | Activation Clustering, Neuron Ablation, Parametric Alignment | Neural circuits, functional specialization, component roles |
| **Concept-based Explanations** | Maps internal representations to human-understandable concepts.          | TCAV, Concept Bottleneck Models, Concept Agents             | Conceptual reasoning, human-interpretable abstractions      |
| **Mechanistic Interpretability** | Dissects neural circuits to reveal precise computational steps.          | Circuit Tracing, FFN analysis (key-value memories), ACDC     | Causal pathways, functional interdependence, internal logic |

This section outlines several key global explanation methodologies, each contributing distinct insights into LLM interpretability. **Probing Techniques** serve as an initial step, inferring encoded linguistic, syntactic, or semantic information by training auxiliary models or designing specific experiments to analyze internal representations [13,25,30]. They help localize where specific types of knowledge are stored within the model's architecture. Moving deeper, **Neuron Activation Analysis** shifts focus to the granular examination of individual neurons or groups of components within these representations, aiming to elucidate their specific functional roles and relationships with various language attributes or overall model performance [13,30]. This approach seeks to unravel the underlying neural "circuits" that govern model behavior [12].

Building upon these foundational analyses, **Concept-based Explanations** aim to bridge the gap between low-level model features and human-interpretable abstractions. These methods map internal representations to predefined or discovered human-understandable concepts and quantify their importance in driving an LLM's predictions, providing explanations that are more intuitive and relatable to human cognition [13,22,25,30]. Finally, **Mechanistic Interpretability** represents the most ambitious approach, seeking to dissect LLM internal neural circuits to uncover precise computational steps and causal pathways, thereby providing a deep, causal understanding of how LLMs process information and arrive at decisions [25,30]. This typically involves viewing neural networks from a "circuit perspective" to discern the functional roles of individual neurons and their intricate connections [12,30].

Beyond these core LLM-specific techniques, other general XAI methods contribute to global understanding, such as Feature Visualization and Attribution methods (e.g., Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots, Permutation Feature Importance) [17,31], which visualize how feature changes influence predictions. The InterpretableLLM framework also includes global layers for Concept Extraction, Bias Detection, Knowledge Graph Construction, and Decision Boundary Analysis to understand overall behavior [32].

A significant trend in advancing global explanations involves leveraging LLMs themselves for analysis. This includes LLMs aiding in the design of inherently interpretable ML architectures (Intrinsic Explainability) [11] or generating candidate concepts for concept-based models, thereby enhancing the scalability and practicality of interpretability efforts [24]. The ongoing research in this domain continually pushes towards more robust, automated, and scalable interpretability tools to keep pace with the increasing complexity of LLMs, moving from post-hoc analysis to embedding interpretability directly into model design [17]. For example, NeuroBreak extensively uses global explanation methods like probing and neuron activation analysis to gain insights into the overall internal workings of LLM safety mechanisms, including macroscopic semantic distributions and inter-neuronal functional analysis [18]. The integration of these diverse methodologies offers a comprehensive suite of tools for gaining profound insights into the inner workings of LLMs.
##### 5.2.2.1 Probing Techniques
Probing techniques serve as a fundamental approach to infer the linguistic, syntactic, or semantic information encoded within different layers or components of a Large Language Model (LLM) [13,25,30]. This methodology involves designing specific experiments or training simpler auxiliary models to "probe" the internal representations learned by the LLM, thereby analyzing the knowledge acquired by the model [30]. This helps demystify the internal workings of LLMs, which is crucial for building trust and ensuring reliability [31].

Probing techniques can generally be categorized into two primary types: classifier-based probing and data-based probing, each offering distinct insights into LLM capabilities.

**Classifier-based Probing.** This approach involves training shallow classifiers on the frozen representations derived from pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs [22,25,30]. The primary objective is to identify specific linguistic attributes, reasoning capabilities, or other semantic information encoded within the model's internal states [22]. These classifiers are then evaluated on held-out datasets to determine their efficacy in predicting the targeted properties [22]. This method provides a mechanistic understanding of *what* information is represented and where it resides within the model's architecture. For instance, studies indicate that lower layers of LLMs are more predictive of word-level syntax, while higher layers tend to capture more abstract sentence-level syntax and semantic knowledge [25].

A prominent example of classifier-based probing is the use of linear probes to interpret high-dimensional hidden representations, mapping them to human-understandable labels. NeuroBreak, for example, extensively employs layer-wise linear probes to detect harmful semantics within LLMs [18]. Technically, a softmax-based formulation is adopted, where the probability of a toxic classification given a hidden state $h$ is expressed as $P(\text{Toxic}|h) = \text{softmax}(w_{\text{toxic}} h + b)$, with $w_{\text{toxic}} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ being the weight vector and $b$ the bias term [18]. Empirical results from NeuroBreak demonstrate that while probe accuracy for detecting harmful semantics is initially low in shallow layers (minimum 76%), it significantly increases to over 90% after the 15th layer, peaking at 93% in the 28th layer. This quantitatively demonstrates that deeper layers of LLMs encode more discriminative harmful features that are linearly separable, thereby localizing specific semantic information [18]. The resulting probe vector $w_{\text{toxic}}$ effectively represents the optimal direction for eliciting harmful content at each layer, serving as a "toxicity vector" for further neuron analysis [18]. Beyond simple linear classifiers, concept extraction through activation clustering and concept vector analysis can also be viewed as advanced forms of probing, revealing specific concepts learned by the model from its activation patterns [32]. Probing classifiers are also recognized as a global explanation technique, offering insights into the general behavior of the model [15].

**Data-based Probing.** In contrast to classifier-based methods, data-based probing assesses the LLM's capabilities by evaluating its performance on specially constructed datasets, without altering its internal parameters [30]. This involves designing specific datasets to test grammatical understanding, semantic coherence, or other targeted aspects of the model's knowledge [25]. By analyzing how the LLM responds to these engineered inputs, researchers can infer what the model has learned or what capabilities it possesses. For example, evaluating LLMs on semantic datasets directly assesses whether generated content conforms to expected grammatical semantics [25]. While models like Aug-imodels leverage LLM representations to enhance explainable downstream models, this differs from probing in that Aug-imodels utilize LLM outputs as features rather than directly analyzing the LLM's internal states to understand its learned knowledge [16].

**Comparison and Contrast.** The distinct methodologies of these two probing techniques lead to different types of insights. Classifier-based probing provides fine-grained, mechanistic insights into *what* specific linguistic or semantic features are encoded at various layers within the LLM. Its strength lies in localizing and quantifying the presence of specific attributes, as exemplified by NeuroBreak's precise detection of toxicity across layers [18]. However, its limitation often stems from the expressiveness of the shallow classifier, which primarily reveals linearly separable features. Data-based probing, on the other hand, offers a more behavioral assessment, evaluating *how well* the LLM performs on targeted tasks and indicating its learned capabilities through observable output. Its strength lies in its directness and intuitive interpretability for assessing overall performance against specific benchmarks. However, it typically offers less insight into the *why* behind the model's behavior, acting more as a black-box evaluation of capabilities rather than a white-box analysis of internal representations. Both methods are crucial for a comprehensive understanding, with classifier-based probing unveiling the internal composition of learned knowledge, and data-based probing verifying its external manifestation. Future developments may involve hybrid approaches that combine the specificity of classifier-based methods with the ecological validity of data-based evaluations.
##### 5.2.2.2 Neuron Activation Analysis
Neuron activation analysis constitutes a crucial interpretability technique that shifts the focus from the opaque entirety of an LLM's vector spaces to the granular examination of individual neurons or dimensions within these representations [13,25]. The primary objective is to elucidate the specific functional roles played by these individual units and to understand their intricate relationships with various language attributes or overall model performance [22,30]. This approach meticulously investigates individual neurons and their connections, aiming to unravel the underlying neural "circuits" that govern model behavior [12].

Typically, neuron activation analysis follows a two-step process to systematically identify and characterize these functional units [25,30]. The first step involves the **identification of significant neurons**, which can be achieved through either unsupervised methods, such as activation clustering [32], or supervised tasks designed to pinpoint neurons critical for specific behaviors [25,30]. For instance, techniques like activation clustering aim to group neuron activations to extract coherent concepts learned by the model [32]. In a more specialized context, NeuroBreak identifies "safety neurons" crucial for handling adversarial prompts by employing SNIP scores to measure their importance across benign and general tasks (e.g., Alpaca dataset), effectively distinguishing them from "utility neurons" [18]. The second step entails **mapping these identified neurons to specific language attributes or aspects of model performance** [25,30]. This mapping can involve correlating neuronal activity with linguistic properties or leveraging techniques such as greedy Gaussian probing to establish a quantitative link between neuronal activation and model performance [30].

The scope of neuron activation analysis has evolved significantly. Traditionally, research often concentrated on a limited subset of critical neurons and their direct connections to semantic attributes [10,22]. However, recent advancements, particularly with the advent of larger models like GPT-4, have enabled a more comprehensive assessment, moving beyond selective analysis to encompass the function of all neurons within a model [10,22]. This broader perspective is crucial for understanding how concepts are distributed throughout the network's multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [12].

While individual neuron analysis remains foundational, some methodologies extend this concept to groups of components. For instance, Functional XAI (fXAI) within the SoS-ML framework proposes analyzing "functional units" or "Regions of Interest (ROIs)"—groups of components—rather than individual neurons, drawing parallels with neuroscience's study of brain regions like Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas for language processing. This approach seeks to provide a higher-level understanding of an AI system's decision-making by making the function of modular units explainable, even if underlying computations are complex [17]. This represents a nuanced difference, advocating for a coarser, yet potentially more interpretable, granularity of analysis compared to strictly individual neuron investigation.

Various advanced techniques and tools enhance neuron activation analysis. Vig (2020) developed a visualization tool for models like BERT and GPT-2, offering insights from individual neurons up to entire model layers, thereby facilitating the linking of neuronal activity with overall model behavior [24]. Conmy et al. (2023) further advanced this by automating partial mechanistic interpretability workflows through algorithms like Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC), which identifies subgraphs corresponding to specific behaviors or functions by analyzing neuron connections [24]. Another powerful intervention-based technique is **neuron activation ablation**, which involves modifying internal or input variables to observe causal effects. This method helps isolate which specific components or representations drive particular decisions, offering a direct way to understand their impact [15]. Conceptually, such methods share parallels with techniques like Grad-CAM and Saliency maps used in other deep learning domains (e.g., radiology), which visualize decision-making contributions of internal components [31].

Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of neuron activation analysis in practical scenarios. NeuroBreak, for example, defines a neuron as the minimal functional unit extracting specific feature patterns through linear computation, with each row of parameter matrices forming an individual neuron [18]. It provides a detailed functional classification of Wdown neurons based on their **parametric alignment** ($S_i^k = (w_{\text{down},i}^k \cdot w_{\text{toxic}}^k) / (||w_{\text{down},i}^k|| ||w_{\text{toxic}}^k||)$) with a layer's toxicity vector and their **activation projection** ($A_i^k = a_{\text{down},i}^k \cdot (w_{\text{toxic}}^k / ||w_{\text{toxic}}^k||)$) during inference. This dual perspective enables categorizing neurons into S+A+ (Toxic feature enhancement), S-A+ (Benign feature suppression), S+A- (Toxic feature suppression), and S-A- (Benign feature enhancement), accounting for both inherent propensity and context-sensitive dynamics [18]. Furthermore, NeuroBreak employs gradient-based association analysis to quantify causal relationships and collaborative patterns by tracing how parameter perturbations propagate to Wdown activations from upstream neurons [18]. A compelling case study involved an expert identifying Layer 11 as a critical decision point for AutoDan attacks. In the Neuron View, disabling specific "security-enforcing" regions in this layer caused samples to shift towards harmful semantics or decision boundaries, empirically validating their protective role [18].

In summary, neuron activation analysis has progressed from focusing on isolated critical neurons to enabling a comprehensive examination of all neurons, and even to the study of functional groups or "circuits." The integration of visualization tools, automated discovery algorithms, and intervention-based techniques like ablation provides powerful means to dissect LLM internal mechanisms. Future developments are likely to further refine these techniques, enabling a more precise understanding of collective neuron behavior and the distributed representation of knowledge and functionalities within increasingly complex LLM architectures.
##### 5.2.2.3 Concept-based Explanations
Concept-based explanations represent a crucial approach for enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by bridging the gap between low-level model features and human-interpretable abstractions [25]. Unlike methods that focus on individual feature importance or local predictions, concept-based explanations operate by mapping input instances to a predefined or discovered set of human-understandable concepts. Subsequently, they quantify the importance of these concepts in driving an LLM's prediction, thereby offering explanations that are more intuitive and relatable to human cognition [10,13,22,30]. This allows for a higher level of abstraction in explanations, moving beyond mere input saliency to explain model behavior in terms of semantic meaning.

A foundational and representative framework within this paradigm is Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) [25,30]. TCAV works by defining "concept activation vectors" in the model's internal representation space. These vectors are learned from examples representing a specific concept (e.g., "striped," "fluffy" for image classification, or "positive sentiment," "toxicity" for text). The method then calculates concept importance scores based on how these concept vectors activate different parts of the model (e.g., hidden layers) for a given prediction. By doing so, TCAV quantifies the degree to which a human-understandable concept contributes to an LLM's decision-making process, making the model's reasoning more transparent.

Beyond the post-hoc analysis offered by methods like TCAV, concept-based explainability also extends to inherent, or ante-hoc, approaches. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and Neural Additive Models (NAMs) exemplify this category [15]. These models are explicitly designed to embed interpretability directly into their architecture. They operate by first predicting human-understandable concepts from the input and then using these concept predictions to generate the final output. This design principle inherently offers high interpretability and strong causal fidelity, as the model's decision path is explicitly routed through meaningful concepts. However, a significant limitation of CBMs and NAMs is that they often require substantial model redesign and may not be scalable for complex LLM architectures or diverse tasks [15].

The challenge of manually specifying concepts, a common requirement for many concept-based methods, has led to the development of automated or semi-automated concept discovery techniques. For instance, `LaBo` (Language-guided Bottleneck) by Yang et al. (2023) offers a method for constructing high-performance CBMs without explicit manual concept specification [24]. `LaBo` leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3 to automatically generate factual sentences as candidate concepts, which are then aligned with input data (e.g., images using CLIP) to form effective bottleneck layers. This innovative approach mitigates the labor-intensive aspect of concept definition, enhancing the practicality of concept-based methods [24].

Another perspective on integrating concepts involves dynamic and interactive frameworks. The SoS-ML framework introduces **Concept Agents** as functional units designed to approximate human understanding of various concepts [17]. These agents, which can be specialized ML models or scripts, are crucial for incorporating human feedback and domain knowledge. They serve as "scaffolding" within a Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) to facilitate the AI system's alignment with human understanding and can translate raw inference and contextual information into **Contextual Explanation_AI** tailored for human interpretation [17]. This highlights an evolution towards more adaptive and user-centric concept-based explanations.

Beyond general explainability, concept-based methods are also applied to address specific model behaviors. For example, NeuroBreak utilizes a "toxicity vector" ($w_{\text{toxic}}$), derived from linear probes, to represent the direction in the activation space associated with harmful content [18]. By quantifying the importance of neurons and their activations in relation to this toxicity concept, NeuroBreak reveals internal jailbreaking mechanisms, demonstrating a targeted application of concept-based insights for safety and alignment. This approach, which involves parametric alignment and activation projection, aligns with the principles of concept-based explanation frameworks [18]. Furthermore, research also explores how LLMs internally process abstract concepts, such as processing across multiple languages using shared neural representations, which offers fundamental insights into their conceptual understanding [12]. General concept extraction techniques further categorize this field into **Concept Vector Analysis**, **Concept Relation Mining**, and **Concept Importance Evaluation**, providing a structured way to understand the model's internal knowledge [32].

While concept-based methods offer significant promise, challenges remain. The hypothetical empirical results cited for a concept extraction framework, indicating 83.5% accuracy and 4.7/5 comprehensibility, underscore the need for more rigorous, non-hypothetical validation with real-world data [32]. The inherent tension between the causal fidelity of ante-hoc methods like CBMs and their scalability limitations, versus the broader applicability but potentially weaker causal guarantees of post-hoc methods, necessitates further research [15]. Future developments are likely to focus on robust, automated, and scalable concept discovery methods, enhanced integration of human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms, and comprehensive empirical evaluations to establish the practical utility and trustworthiness of concept-based explanations for LLMs [31]. The integration of dynamic concept agents and advanced concept extraction techniques will be critical in advancing the field towards more intuitive and actionable LLM explanations.
##### 5.2.2.4 Mechanistic Interpretability
Mechanistic interpretability (MI) represents an ambitious approach to understanding large language models (LLMs) by dissecting their internal neural circuits, focusing on the function of individual neurons and their intricate connections [25,30]. This methodology aims to reveal the precise computational steps and causal pathways within the model, thereby providing a deep understanding of how LLMs process information and arrive at decisions. While promising, the application of MI to large-scale LLMs is still in its nascent stages and presents significant complexity [25,30]. The core idea involves viewing neural networks from a "circuit perspective," analyzing individual neurons and their connections to discern their functional roles and overall contribution to model behavior [12,30].

A foundational aspect of mechanistic interpretability involves the analysis of specific internal components. For instance, circuit tracing is recognized as a global explanation technique offering insights into the general behavior of models [15]. Researchers have specifically investigated the role of Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) within LLMs, identifying them as primary sites for knowledge storage, operating akin to "key-value memories" [8,22]. Within this structure, the first FFN layer functions as a "key layer" to detect specific language or knowledge patterns, while the second acts as a "value layer" to generate corresponding responses. This intricate mechanism reveals a hierarchical organization: lower FFN layers primarily engage with surface-level lexical and syntactic knowledge, whereas higher layers process more abstract semantic and factual conceptual knowledge [22].

Beyond understanding knowledge representation, MI has been applied to analyze specific model behaviors and identify causal structures. Wang et al. (2022) conducted circuit analysis and reverse engineering on GPT-2 small, pinpointing specific attention heads responsible for identifying indirect objects [24]. To streamline such complex analyses, Conmy et al. (2023) developed algorithms like Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC), which automates the identification of subgraphs linked to particular neural network behaviors or functions [24]. Furthermore, Wu et al. (2023) utilized Boundless DAS to uncover interpretable causal structures within LLMs, demonstrating how a 7B parameter LLM like Alpaca solves numerical reasoning problems through interpretable boolean variables, offering a mechanistic insight into its reasoning process [24]. Another application is demonstrated by NeuroBreak, which employs MI to unveil internal jailbreak mechanisms in LLMs by analyzing the functional interdependence and inter-neuron collaboration patterns, moving beyond treating neurons in isolation [18]. The "Break the Neurons" function in NeuroBreak allows for direct causal intervention and validation, enabling testing hypotheses about specific neuron roles [18].

While traditional MI focuses on post-hoc analysis of existing models, a distinct trajectory involves embedding interpretability into the design phase. The SoS-ML framework exemplifies this by advocating for "functional interpretability" (fXAI) rather than merely "model interpretability" [17]. This approach proposes that transparency should emerge from modular design, where developers understand the contributions of *groups of components* (functional units or Regions of Interest, ROIs) to overall decisions, even if individual internal workings remain complex [17]. This shifts the paradigm towards intrinsically explainable AI systems, where mechanistic insights are a byproduct of foundational design choices. Similarly, the concept of "Intrinsic Explainability," where LLMs aid in designing inherently interpretable ML architectures and visualizing neural network decision paths, aligns with the goals of MI by fostering an internal understanding of model function [11]. Complementary efforts include the construction of knowledge graphs to analyze the internal structure and organization of learned knowledge, aiming to extract entities and relations from model representations to identify knowledge gaps, which contributes to understanding functional roles within the model [32]. Although the empirical results for such knowledge graph methods (e.g., 81.9% accuracy and 4.8/5 comprehensibility in hypothetical evaluations) are illustrative rather than from actual experiments, they highlight the potential for structural analysis [32].

The insights derived from mechanistic interpretability have practical implications, extending to areas such as model knowledge editing, content control, and model pruning [8]. Despite its promise, the complexity of dissecting and understanding the billions of parameters and their interactions in modern LLMs remains a significant challenge, necessitating continued in-depth research to fully realize its potential [30]. The progression from analyzing individual neurons to understanding functional units and designing for interpretability represents a multi-faceted and evolving research landscape within explainable AI.
### 5.3 Explainability for Prompting-based Models (In-context Learning and Chain-of-Thought)
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a transformative "prompting-based paradigm" for interacting with and leveraging these models, fundamentally shifting from traditional fine-tuning methods [13,30]. This paradigm enables LLMs to exhibit remarkable emergent capabilities, including few-shot learning and sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which were previously unattainable [25]. Consequently, the focus of explainable AI (XAI) for LLMs under this new paradigm diverges significantly from prior approaches. The increased scale and intrinsic complexity of these models, coupled with their emergent behaviors, render many conventional XAI techniques inadequate, necessitating novel methodologies tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt-based interactions [30].

Within this context, the primary explainability goal is to unravel *how* these emergent behaviors occur and why models perform as they do. Explainability efforts are often bifurcated, addressing the distinct capabilities and learning processes of base models versus assistant models [10,13,22,25,30]. Prompting itself plays a dual role: it is not only the mechanism through which LLMs operate but also a powerful tool for generating explanations, exemplified by "Explainable Prompting" techniques like CoT [11,15]. Instruction prompts, for instance, can guide LLMs to adhere to factual information, avoid speculation, and tailor output for different user groups, thereby enhancing explainability in domain-specific applications [20]. Conversely, the vulnerability of prompting to adversarial manipulations, such as jailbreak attacks crafted to bypass safety mechanisms, underscores the critical need for understanding the internal impact of these prompts on LLM representations and neuron activations [18].

A significant practical application where the explainability of prompting-based models is paramount is in LLM evaluation. When LLMs serve as evaluators, their generated assessments and the underlying justifications inherently demand scrutiny and explanation to establish trustworthiness and reliability [21]. This highlights the broader challenge of connecting model complexity with user trust, a core objective of XAI [31].



![XAI Aspects for Prompting-based LLMs](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/3xHd65vPDOmZ_K97EoFou_XAI%20Aspects%20for%20Prompting-based%20LLMs.png)

This section will further delineate the core mechanisms and explainability challenges associated with key aspects of prompting-based LLMs. Specifically, it will delve into Understanding In-Context Learning (ICL) Mechanisms, Explaining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning, and Representation Engineering, which together form a foundational framework for comprehending and controlling LLMs within this paradigm [22,25,30].
#### 5.3.1 Understanding In-Context Learning (ICL) Mechanisms
In-Context Learning (ICL) represents an emergent and pivotal capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to acquire new concepts and perform novel tasks directly from a few examples provided within the input prompt, crucially without requiring any updates to the model's parameters [13,22,30,33]. This process draws an analogy to human learning through experience, where individuals grasp new tasks from limited exposure [22]. While ICL is often discussed in conjunction with few-shot learning and prompt engineering, it is essential to distinguish these concepts: few-shot learning describes the paradigm where a model learns from a small number of examples, a capability directly enabled by ICL; prompt learning or engineering, conversely, refers to the methodology of designing effective input prompts—including the selection and arrangement of in-context examples—to elicit optimal ICL performance from LLMs [33].

ICL offers several significant advantages that underscore its importance. Firstly, it provides an interpretable interface, as demonstrations are formulated in natural language, making interaction with LLMs more accessible and intuitive [22]. Secondly, it facilitates the seamless integration of human knowledge, allowing users to incorporate domain-specific expertise into the LLM's context by simply modifying demonstrations and templates [22]. Lastly, ICL is characterized by its low computational cost, operating as a training-free framework that substantially reduces the resources required for adapting models to new tasks, thus streamlining LLM deployment as a service [22].

The performance of ICL is influenced by two primary stages: an initial phase focused on training LLMs to acquire ICL capabilities, and a subsequent inference phase where LLMs execute tasks based on specific in-context demonstrations [22]. To enhance ICL capabilities, an optional "Warmup Stage" can be implemented, representing a continuous training phase between pre-training and ICL inference. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, which targets specific task performance, this stage aims to bolster general ICL abilities. Furthermore, to bridge the disparity between pre-training objectives and downstream ICL goals, LLMs can undergo "Supervised/Self-supervised In-context Training." This involves updating model parameters by training on supervised ICL data or self-supervised data constructed from raw corpora (e.g., through masked token prediction or language modeling objectives) [22]. Research suggests that while a Warmup stage is beneficial, performance gains tend to plateau with increasing data size, indicating that LLMs require only a minimal amount of data for effective adaptation during this phase [22].

Numerous factors influence ICL performance. During the pre-training phase, the characteristics of the corpus, such as its source and diversity, may be more critical than its sheer size. The integration of multiple corpora can unlock new ICL capabilities, although task-relevant corpora do not consistently guarantee improved performance. Concurrently, the number of pre-trained model parameters and the extent of training steps are significant determinants of ICL capability [22,33]. ICL is recognized as an "emergent behavior" that manifests as LLMs scale in parameters and training data diversity [27]. In the inference phase, the attributes of the provided examples and the correctness of their labels play a crucial role, with their impact varying depending on specific implementation configurations [22]. Moreover, LLM performance in ICL is highly sensitive to the structure and wording of prompts [24]. For instance, applying a "zero-shot chain of thoughts prompt technique" to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the context of OA management did not yield significant performance improvements, illustrating the complex interplay between prompting strategies and specific model/task combinations [20].

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of ICL is a critical area of research, with ongoing efforts to demystify how LLMs rapidly grasp new tasks from limited examples and to enable end-users to interpret their reasoning [30]. Studies have employed techniques such as analyzing contrasting demonstrations and saliency maps to investigate ICL's operation [24,25,30]. A notable finding from such research is that flipping labels in demonstrations reduced saliency for smaller models (e.g., GPT-2) but had the opposite effect on larger models (e.g., InstructGPT) [30]. This quantitative difference highlights that the impact of various demonstration types is highly dependent on model scale and task type. Another line of inquiry explores whether ICL is primarily driven by semantic priors ingrained during pre-training or by the model's ability to learn arbitrary input-label mappings from examples. Findings suggest that larger models possess the capacity to learn and override semantic priors to map arbitrary inputs to labels, challenging the notion that ICL is solely a function of prior knowledge [30]. Furthermore, theoretical explorations propose that ICL may arise from specific training data distribution properties or operate as an implicit Bayesian inference. Mechanistically, LLMs might function as meta-optimizers, with ICL exhibiting characteristics akin to implicit fine-tuning [22]. From a functional component perspective, "induction heads" within Transformer models, responsible for copying previous patterns to predict subsequent tokens, are considered potential sources of the ICL mechanism [22]. Research also differentiates the working mechanisms of ICL in large models compared to medium-sized models, further emphasizing the scale-dependent nature of this phenomenon [10].

A crucial application and implication of ICL is its role in enabling LLMs to function as evaluators. Models such as T0, InstructGPT, and ChatGPT leverage their zero-shot in-context learning capabilities, allowing them to perform complex evaluation tasks solely based on provided instructions, samples, and questions, without requiring specific prior fine-tuning for evaluation purposes [21]. This inherent capacity is what underpins their ability to act as reliable evaluators in various contexts. Consequently, the explainability of ICL becomes paramount for ensuring the trustworthiness and reliability of these evaluation processes, making its comprehensive understanding indispensable for the advancement of LLM applications [21,22].
#### 5.3.2 Explaining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for enhancing the explainability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) [13,15,33]. By encouraging LLMs to generate intermediate, step-by-step reasoning before providing a final answer, CoT transforms complex problem-solving into a more transparent process [22]. This method is characterized by its structured approach, typically including an instruction, a rationale with intermediate steps, and often few-shot examples [22]. Variations include Zero-Shot-CoT, activated by simple phrases like "Let's think step by step," and Few-Shot-CoT, which provides detailed problem-solving examples to guide the model's reasoning [22]. The fundamental appeal of CoT lies in its ability to break down problems into sub-problems, thereby improving reasoning capabilities, aiding in understanding model workings, and facilitating error identification [22]. It also enhances controllability by making the problem-solving process visible and debuggable, and its simple prompting mechanism offers broad usability and flexibility across various LLM applications, extending beyond language tasks to scientific and AI agent domains [22].

Despite its demonstrated benefits, the field acknowledges advanced variants of CoT, such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph of Thoughts (GoT), which further structure the reasoning process, although detailed comparisons within the provided literature are limited [8]. For instance, some analyses explicitly note that they do not delve into these advanced concepts [15,30,32].

A critical aspect of CoT explanations is their fidelity—whether the generated reasoning accurately reflects the model's true internal decision-making process [12,16,30]. Several studies raise concerns that CoT explanations "may be systematically unfaithful" or "aren't always faithful representations of the model's actual reasoning" [12,30]. For instance, one study highlighted that CoT explanations exhibit only medium alignment with the Causal dimension of explainability, suggesting they "may not trace true causal paths" and represent only weak causal tracing via intermediate steps [15]. Experimental evidence further supports these concerns: manipulating reasoning chains by reordering multiple-choice options revealed that models like GPT-3.5 and Claude 1.0 "failed to acknowledge the impact of these biased features" in their explanations, indicating that CoT might not faithfully represent the actual decision process [24,30]. Furthermore, some findings suggest that intermediate reasoning steps can sometimes act "as beacons for copying symbols to factual answers rather than facilitating learning to solve the task" [30]. Intriguingly, empirical observations indicate that "smaller models tend to produce more faithful explanations compared to larger, more capable models" [30].

A case study employing the MQUAKE-CF dataset to investigate CoT fidelity in complex multi-hop question answering tasks provided nuanced results [8]. By intentionally modifying information within a generated CoT to be incorrect and then prompting the model to produce new answers, researchers aimed to determine if models would follow the erroneous CoT. The study found that newer generation LLMs (e.g., Vicuna-v1.5, LLaMA2-7B, Falcon-7B, Mistral-v0.1/0.2-7B) frequently *refused* to make predictions based on the incorrect CoT. This counter-intuitive result suggests that for these advanced models, the generated CoT may not be a faithful explanation of their underlying reasoning, as they override the explicit (but incorrect) reasoning provided [8]. Conversely, older LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-J, LLaMA-7B), particularly larger instances, demonstrated better CoT fidelity by following the erroneous reasoning, indicating that their generated CoT could be considered a more effective explanation for their predictions [8]. This contrast highlights a potential shift in the relationship between generated CoT and internal model mechanisms in more recent architectures.

To address fidelity issues and deepen the understanding of LLM reasoning, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies and analytical tools. Preliminary research indicates that decomposing problems into sub-problems and answering them separately can enhance CoT reasoning fidelity [30]. Post-processing methods like "Rethinking with Retrieval" use CoT prompts refined with external knowledge to generate more accurate and reliable explanations, improving performance in complex reasoning tasks [24]. Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) further prompts LLMs to perform meta-reasoning over multiple inference chains, thereby enhancing fact selection and explanation generation [24]. Furthermore, datasets such as SCIENCEQA have been utilized to train LLMs to generate explanations as part of a CoT process, leading to improved reasoning abilities and QA performance in multimodal domains [24].

A specific technical advancement for objectively identifying influential steps within a CoT is the concept of **Thought Anchors** [3]. Defined as key sentences within a CoT trajectory that exert a disproportionate influence on subsequent steps and the final answer, Thought Anchors provide an abstract layer to decompose the otherwise opaque autoregressive reasoning of LLMs [3]. Analyzing these anchors is posited as crucial for understanding structured reasoning, facilitating error correction, and improving model reliability, offering critical intervention points to enhance the integrity of LLM outputs [3].

Beyond improving internal model understanding, CoT-like abilities are leveraged in application contexts, particularly when LLMs act as evaluators. For instance, in prompt-based evaluation scenarios, LLMs can be instructed to follow a multi-step "chain of thought" for assessing tasks like code generation [29]. This structured process involves parsing prompts, checking for errors, comparing outputs, and performing static analysis, culminating in the LLM being required to "Come up an explanation for the score assigned" [29]. This mechanism provides a form of intrinsic explanation for their judgments by articulating the rationale behind their assigned scores, citing specific parts of the input to support their conclusions, thereby contributing to the broader goal of explainable AI in practical settings [22].

Despite its promise, CoT still faces several limitations. It exhibits a "lack of generality," being most effective for specific problem types like arithmetic and common-sense reasoning, with less potent effects on open-ended question answering [22]. Indeed, in some domain-specific applications like OA management, zero-shot CoT showed "no significant improvements in model performance" compared to basic input-output techniques for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 [20]. There remains a "lack of explainability analysis" methods for in-depth evaluation of generated reasoning paths, an "unresolved problem" of prompt design dependency, and an "increased computational overhead" due to generating more text [22]. Furthermore, a "lack of theoretical support" for why CoT is effective persists [22]. Future research must continue to critically appraise CoT explanations, exploring their theoretical underpinnings and developing robust methods for ensuring and evaluating their fidelity in increasingly complex LLM applications.
#### 5.3.3 Representation Engineering
Representation engineering stands as an advanced explainability method that endeavors to unravel and steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) through direct manipulation of their internal representations [25]. This approach adopts a top-down perspective, focusing on the intricate structure and features of the LLM's representation space to capture emergent cognitive phenomena and high-level concepts [13,25,30]. Its potential lies in revealing the mechanisms by which complex concepts are encoded and processed within the model, offering practical applications in enhancing model safety and ensuring output alignment with desired behaviors [25,30].

The methodology of representation engineering typically bifurcates into two principal components: representation reading and representation control [30].
1.  **Representation Reading**: This component focuses on identifying and deciphering high-level concepts and functions embedded within the network's internal states. Drawing inspiration from neuroimaging techniques, researchers design prompt templates containing specific stimuli or instructions to elicit these concepts [30]. Neural activity is subsequently collected from the representations of the most salient tokens or the final token in the sequence. Linear probes are then employed to predict the presence and nature of these concepts and functions from the extracted neural activity, thereby mapping abstract ideas to concrete internal states [30]. For instance, research has successfully revealed linear structures within representations corresponding to truth/falsity and spatio-temporal concepts, with trained probes demonstrating robust generalization across diverse datasets [30]. LLMs such as LLaMA-13B have been shown to learn linear representations of space and time, with the accuracy of these representations improving with increased model scale and the activation of specialized neurons for such changes [30].
2.  **Representation Control**: Building upon the insights garnered from representation reading, this component aims to actively manipulate these identified internal representations to achieve specific objectives, such as safety enhancements or behavioral alignment [30]. A notable example involves directly adding "read vectors" to induce honest model outputs or subtracting them to provoke deceptive responses, highlighting the profound potential for targeted model improvement [30].

Beyond these core components, representation engineering manifests in various specific applications. For instance, the understanding that LLMs primarily store knowledge within their Feed-Forward Network (FFN) structures, which operate as "key-value memories," facilitates the direct localization and modification of knowledge [22]. Each neuron in the FFN's key layer detects specific language or knowledge patterns, and upon a match, extracts an associated value. This mechanism enables researchers to identify specific FFN nodes storing outdated knowledge and directly adjust their parameters to instill new information, effectively engineering the model's internal representations of factual knowledge [22]. Similarly, the NeuroBreak framework leverages representation engineering by deriving "toxicity vectors" from probe models to represent harmful semantic features within the hidden space [18]. By analyzing neuron functions based on their "parametric alignment" and "activation dynamics" to these security-critical features, the system can identify, understand, and implicitly manipulate these functional representations to enhance safety through targeted fine-tuning [18].

Further illustrating its versatility, representation engineering also encompasses interventions at broader conceptual levels. Research highlights the ability to understand how "concepts are distributed throughout the network's MLPs and attention mechanisms" and to "intervene in model behavior by manipulating specific neural pathways" [12]. This directly aligns with the principle of analyzing and controlling internal states to steer model behavior. Even programming LLMs with "specific, adversarial roles" through prompts (e.g., Guardian, Synthesizer, Innovator) constitutes a form of behavior steering that inherently involves manipulating the high-level concepts and functional representations guiding the LLM's output for tasks like peer review [9]. From a feature engineering perspective, Aug-Linear models exemplify representation engineering by extracting fixed-size feature representations $\phi(x_i)$ for each input ngram $x_i$ using pre-trained LLMs [16]. These LLM embeddings, which can incorporate label-specific information via fine-tuning, form the basis for interpretable linear models, showcasing the utility of engineered representations for improved model efficiency and accuracy [16].

The SoS-ML framework further contextualizes the importance of internal representation ($$IR_{Agt}$$), defining it as composed of the dataset portion corresponding to a concept ($$fD_j$$), inferred generalized aspects ($$gCT$$), dataset errors ($$t_{e_j}$$), and agent biases ($$e_{bias}$$): $$IR_{Agt} = (fD_j) \cup (gCT) \cup (e_{bias} \cup t_{e_j})$$ [17]. This framework underscores that the unique nature of each agent's internal representation introduces subjectivity, necessitating multiple agents for optimal information utilization. The concept of "Final Conversion Loss"—the information loss during the conversion of complex internal representations to simplified outputs—highlights potential biases or distortions, which are crucial considerations for representation engineering aimed at ensuring transparency in multi-agent systems [17].

Despite its promise in enabling detailed understanding and precise control over LLM outputs, the field of representation engineering still requires extensive validation. Specifically, comprehensive ablation studies are necessary to fully delineate its advantages and disadvantages [30]. The ongoing research aims to fully validate its effectiveness and to explore the implications for aligning LLM behaviors with complex human values and intentions [25,30]. Addressing these challenges will be critical for representation engineering to fully bridge the gap between model complexity and trustworthiness [15,31].
### 5.4 Explainability for Assistant Models
Assistant models represent a specialized category of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have undergone extensive optimization beyond initial unsupervised pre-training, primarily through instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), to exhibit enhanced helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty [25,30]. These models, exemplified by InstructGPT and ChatGPT, acquire foundational semantic knowledge during pre-training and then refine domain-specific behaviors and preferences during subsequent alignment phases [21,22]. The increasing autonomy of these agentic LLMs demands robust explanation frameworks to address their emergent and sometimes unpredictable outputs [15].

Given their advanced capabilities and deployment in sensitive applications, explainability for assistant models is crucial for fostering trust and ensuring reliable performance [25,30]. Despite their strong reasoning abilities, their vast scale renders them susceptible to problematic outputs, such as hallucinations [25,30]. Consequently, research in this domain focuses on clarifying the impact of the alignment fine-tuning process, analyzing the underlying causes of hallucinations, and quantifying the inherent uncertainty in their predictions [13,25,30]. Furthermore, for specialized assistants like DocOA in medical applications, explainability is vital for improving both clinical utility and transparency [20].

The specific explainability challenges for these models involve understanding how their knowledge is acquired and modified during various training stages, diagnosing vulnerabilities in safety alignments (e.g., against jailbreak attacks), and ensuring the integrity of their reasoning processes [18,22]. Assistant models are frequently employed in applications such as automated evaluation due to their enhanced instruction-following and explanation-generating capabilities, highlighting their critical role in complex interactive tasks [21]. Their ability to provide detailed explanations for ratings or even refuse to answer based on ethical training principles underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind these responses [21].



![Core Explainability Dimensions for LLM Assistant Models](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/kgYRzcJV5rDY_nqeOox9T_Core%20Explainability%20Dimensions%20for%20LLM%20Assistant%20Models.png)

This section will delve into three core explainability dimensions for assistant models:
1.  **Explaining the Role of Alignment/Fine-tuning**: This sub-section will dissect how the different training phases, particularly supervised learning and RLHF, shape an LLM's core capabilities, knowledge acquisition, and behavioral alignment, offering a nuanced view of their respective contributions.
2.  **Explaining and Mitigating Hallucinations**: This sub-section will systematically analyze the causes of hallucinatory outputs, distinguishing between dataset-related issues and model-inherent limitations, and explore various explainability-driven strategies for detection and mitigation.
3.  **Uncertainty Quantification**: This sub-section will address the critical need for assessing the reliability of LLM predictions, especially in high-stakes domains, by reviewing methods for estimating and expressing model confidence.

By examining these interconnected aspects, this section aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the unique explainability requirements of assistant models, identifying commonalities and contrasting differences across various studies, and prognosticating future development trajectories for building more transparent and reliable LLM systems. Claims within this framework are substantiated by technical results and experimental findings from the literature, including quantified differences and appraisals of strengths and weaknesses [15,31].
#### 5.4.1 Explaining the Role of Alignment/Fine-tuning
The explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to understanding how their vast knowledge and capabilities are acquired and refined across different training phases. A central question in this domain revolves around whether an LLM's core capabilities originate predominantly from its initial unsupervised pre-training or from subsequent alignment and fine-tuning stages, such as supervised learning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [10,22,25,30]. This distinction is crucial for developing robust and explainable agentic LLMs [15].

Assistant models typically undergo a two-stage training paradigm: an initial unsupervised pre-training phase, which imbues them with general language representations and foundational knowledge, followed by an alignment fine-tuning phase that adapts them to specific tasks, user instructions, and human preferences [22,30]. While the initial pre-training phase establishes a broad base of general knowledge [20], the role of the subsequent fine-tuning stages in shaping an LLM's final behavior, usefulness, and safety is a subject of ongoing inquiry.

Recent studies suggest that a significant portion of an LLM's intrinsic knowledge is acquired during the pre-training phase [30]. For instance, one notable finding demonstrates that a LLaMA-65B model, when fine-tuned with only 1000 instructions (without RLHF), achieved performance levels comparable to GPT-4. This implies that alignment, in some contexts, might primarily involve a simpler process focused on refining interaction style and format rather than fundamentally altering the model's core knowledge base, thereby challenging the perceived necessity of highly complex fine-tuning and RL techniques for knowledge acquisition [30]. This perspective posits that pre-training forms the bedrock, and fine-tuning acts as an activation mechanism, making this knowledge accessible for useful outputs, with RL further aligning these outputs with human values [30].

However, the alignment and fine-tuning phases are indispensable for shaping an LLM's task performance, aligning it with human expectations, and ensuring its safety and utility. Instruction fine-tuning, for example, empowers models to better distinguish instructions from context, accurately follow user commands, and focus on critical elements within prompts. This process facilitates the adaptation of concepts for downstream tasks while preserving the underlying language distribution [30]. Interestingly, research indicates that while semantic knowledge captured by self-attention heads initially grows, it can sharply decline in higher layers of fine-tuned models, suggesting a redistribution or refocusing of information processing. This adaptation involves lower-layer neurons encoding word-word patterns for instruction verb recognition, enabling the model to respond more effectively to specific directives [30]. Furthermore, data quality, rather than sheer quantity, has been identified as a more critical factor during instruction fine-tuning, influencing the efficacy of this stage [30]. Imitation tuning, which involves fine-tuning base models on outputs from more advanced systems, can enhance an LLM's style, role adherence, and instruction-following capabilities, although it shows limited improvement in complex dimensions such as factual accuracy, coding, or intricate problem-solving [30].

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stands out as a particularly impactful alignment technique, crucial for instilling complex behaviors and preferences. For instance, in the context of LLMs performing human-like evaluation tasks, RLHF is critical for aligning models to understand and follow diverse criteria, enabling them to provide coherent and explainable assessments [21]. The safety alignment introduced through RLHF is also evident when models like ChatGPT refuse to rate "likability" by citing their AI nature, demonstrating how fine-tuning dictates their ethical boundaries and response behaviors [21]. Beyond evaluation, safety fine-tuning actively constructs a "conceptual safety mechanism" within LLMs, and jailbreak attacks, by probing internal vulnerabilities, reveal the points where this mechanism can fail. Quantitative evaluations show that targeted fine-tuning strategies, such as TSFT and VA+TSFT, can significantly enhance security with minimal parameter updates while preserving overall model utility, underscoring the efficacy of specific alignment reinforcement strategies [18].

The impact of fine-tuning extends to domain-specific applications, as exemplified by efforts to enhance pre-trained LLMs like GPT-4 for fields such as osteoarthritis [20]. This is achieved by integrating techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and instruction-based prompts, which guide the model to provide evidence-based insights and personalized management, strictly adhere to facts, avoid speculation, and state limitations. This approach is more cost-effective than training a new model from scratch, leveraging the pre-trained model's broad general knowledge while allowing for adjustability and refinement over time to adapt to new domain-specific evidence [20].

In summary, while the initial pre-training phase lays the fundamental knowledge groundwork, the subsequent alignment and fine-tuning stages are pivotal for translating this knowledge into useful, safe, and context-appropriate behaviors. The relative contributions of these distinct phases remain an active and open research question [10], with current evidence suggesting a synergistic relationship where pre-training provides the potential, and fine-tuning, especially through RLHF and instruction-based methods, actualizes and refines it for specific tasks and human interaction. Understanding these nuanced roles is fundamental for advancing LLM explainability and control.
#### 5.4.2 Explaining and Mitigating Hallucinations
Hallucinations, defined as the generation of irrelevant, absurd, plausible-but-false, or factually incorrect outputs, represent a significant concern for the trustworthiness and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) [10,30,34]. This inherent predictive uncertainty poses substantial challenges for their widespread and dependable application [10]. LLMs often prioritize grammatical correctness and plausibility over factual accuracy, sometimes exhibiting overconfidence in erroneous responses [28]. Therefore, understanding and mitigating these phenomena are critical research objectives, where Explainable AI (XAI) plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and intervention [27].

A systematic dissection reveals that LLM hallucinations stem from a combination of dataset-related problems and model-inherent limitations [25,30].

**Causes from Dataset Issues:**
Hallucinations are frequently traceable to shortcomings in the training data [25,28,30]. A primary cause is the **lack of relevant data**, particularly concerning sparse long-tail knowledge, which LLMs often underperform in learning despite its presence in training datasets [25,30]. Conversely, **data repetition** can also degrade performance significantly, with even a 10% duplication rate potentially causing models to "memorize" rather than generalize, thereby consuming capacity and potentially leading to spurious correlations [30]. Furthermore, issues such as insufficient information or mistakes within the training data, or even inadequately contextualized prompts, contribute directly to the generation of hallucinatory content [28].

**Causes from Model-Inherent Limitations:**
Beyond data quality, LLMs possess intrinsic limitations that contribute to hallucinations [30]. A fundamental issue is their **over-reliance on statistical patterns**, wherein LLMs depend on "sentence-level memory and corpus-level statistical patterns rather than robust reasoning" [30]. This leads to **imperfections in knowledge and reasoning**, manifesting as difficulties in remembering and reasoning about ontological knowledge, and frequent "logical derivations due to the inversion curse" [30]. LLMs also tend to be **overconfident in their outputs** and struggle to "accurately identify factual knowledge boundaries" [30]. This can be exacerbated by "shortcut learning" where models prefer co-occurring words over factual answers, or "flattery," aligning responses with user views rather than objective facts, a phenomenon that can intensify with model scaling and instruction tuning [30]. Research using mechanistic interpretability further reveals that hallucinations "occur through separate recognition and recall circuits" within the model, suggesting a complex internal failure mechanism [12]. Even advanced prompting techniques like In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) do not fully prevent "causal hallucination" in reasoning tasks, indicating that the CoT process itself can be flawed, containing errors or logical inconsistencies that reflect or contribute to hallucinations [22,24].

**Explainability for Diagnosing Hallucinations:**
Explainability techniques are instrumental in diagnosing the origins of these hallucinations, thereby informing targeted mitigation strategies [27]. XAI bridges the gap between complex LLM outputs and user trust by providing insights into why and how errors occur [31]. "Hallucination detection" is recognized as a key functional purpose for explainability, aiding model robustness and debugging [15]. **Attribution methods**, such as analyzing attribution scores of input words, can diagnose hallucinations by highlighting which parts of the input contribute to an erroneous output [8]. Similarly, **token-level attribution** can detect unsupported answer tokens in open-domain Question-Answering systems, thereby improving factual precision [15]. **Causal tracing methods** can be applied to reduce hallucinations by pinpointing problematic internal states through attention-based interventions and saliency-guided filtering [15]. Furthermore, understanding the "output uncertainty" of LLMs and analyzing the internal reasoning paths, even those revealed by techniques like CoT, can help diagnose why incorrect or inconsistent outputs arise [22]. The detailed internal understanding provided by **mechanistic interpretability** is crucial for diagnosing these issues at a fundamental level, by tracing the internal "recognition and recall circuits" responsible for hallucination [12].

**Strategies for Mitigating Hallucinations:**
Mitigation strategies span improvements in data, model architecture, and external validation mechanisms.

1.  **Data and Context Augmentation**:
    *   **Improved Training Data**: This involves enhancing fine-tuning datasets and incorporating synthetic data interventions [30]. Providing sufficient context in prompts can also reduce hallucinations [28].
    *   **Knowledge Graph (KG) Augmentation**: Frameworks that integrate explicit, structured knowledge from KGs directly address hallucinations by providing factual grounding. Approaches include KG-augmented LLMs, LLM-augmented KGs, and synergistic LLMs with KGs [24].
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This technique grounds LLM responses in external, verified information, thereby improving accuracy and reliability by retrieving relevant documents from an external knowledge base [8,20]. While effective, RAG systems are not infallible, as `Limitation` instances of incomplete retrieval can still lead to inaccuracies resembling hallucinations [20].
    *   **Input Guard-Railing**: Crafting specific inputs that aid in "guard-railing" the LLM's performance can manage or mitigate hallucination tendencies, leading to better perceived fidelity [4].

2.  **Model-Side Enhancements**:
    *   **Model Scaling**: Larger models, such as PaLM with 540 billion parameters, have demonstrated improved performance and better memory for long-tail knowledge, though limitations persist [30].
    *   **Optimization Methods**: Employing different optimization methods during training can inherently reduce hallucinatory tendencies [30].
    *   **Robustness Enhancement**: Enhancing the LLM’s inherent robustness is a general measure to mitigate potential hallucinations [19].

3.  **External Validation and Human-in-the-Loop**:
    *   **Uncertainty Expression**: Enabling LLMs to provide "expression of uncertainty" in their outputs can improve overall reliability and help users understand when to be cautious [32].
    *   **Human Verification**: Users must be "sceptical of any response" and perform human verification, especially for critical tasks like code generation, to check outputs for accuracy and functionality [28].
    *   **Built-in Error Checking**: Adversarial mechanisms, like a "three-persona" peer review system for LLMs, combined with human oversight, can provide error-checking and final verification of critical claims [9].
    *   **Audits and Quality Checks**: Regular audits and quality checks of LLM outputs are crucial safeguarding measures [19]. The provision of intermediary Python code by models like ChatGPT ADA can also indirectly aid in ascertaining output accuracy and consistency, acting as a mitigation strategy [19].

**Hallucinations in LLM Evaluators**:
A unique manifestation of hallucinations occurs when LLMs are employed as evaluators, where they can produce "factual inaccuracies" in their assessments [10]. While such LLM evaluators might provide scores and convincing explanations, their underlying "reasoning" can still be flawed or unfaithful, mirroring the general hallucination problem in generative LLMs [21]. This renders them potentially unreliable for fact-intensive evaluation tasks and necessitates specific mitigation strategies that incorporate explainability to diagnose the origins of these evaluative inaccuracies [10].

**Future Development Trajectories**:
Future research needs to focus on deeper mechanistic understanding of hallucination circuits, moving beyond statistical correlations to develop LLMs with robust reasoning capabilities. Integrating XAI not only for detection but also for continuous, adaptive mitigation is paramount. This includes developing more sophisticated attribution and causal tracing methods that can operate in real-time, influencing generation processes. Furthermore, the development of intrinsic uncertainty quantification mechanisms within LLMs, rather than post-hoc detection, will be crucial. Quantifying the impact of data quality issues (e.g., how specific types of data repetition or scarcity lead to quantifiable increases in hallucination rates) and model architectural choices will enable more targeted interventions. The challenge of teaching LLMs truthfulness, especially when simplistic countermeasures can lead to "silent failures" that falsely enhance credibility, remains a significant hurdle [34]. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach combining advancements in data curation, model architecture, XAI, and human oversight is essential to progress towards LLMs that are not only powerful but also consistently truthful and reliable.
#### 5.4.3 Uncertainty Quantification
Quantifying the uncertainty inherent in Large Language Model (LLM) predictions is paramount for assessing their reliability and limitations, particularly in high-stakes applications where erroneous or unreliable outputs can have significant consequences [25,30]. The challenge of "output uncertainty" arises from the LLMs' inherent variability, where the same input can yield different responses, complicating the understanding of their decision-making processes and underscoring the need for robust confidence measures [22]. This "model uncertainty and variability" is recognized as a systemic risk for LLMs, necessitating robust explanation frameworks to foster trust and informed usage [15]. In critical domains such as medical diagnosis, the explicit "expression of uncertainty" (不确定性表达) by an AI system is crucial for enabling professionals to make informed decisions [32].

While traditional uncertainty quantification methods often rely on logits, which represent the log-probabilities of tokens, this approach is often less feasible for modern LLMs, especially closed-source models that do not expose direct logit access [30]. This necessitates the development of non-logit-based "confidence elicitation" methods [30].

To address this, several representative approaches for estimating LLM uncertainty have emerged:
1.  **Consistency-based Estimation**: This method involves generating multiple answers or responses to a single query and then assessing the consistency among these outputs to infer the model's confidence [25,30]. This can be achieved by introducing randomness during answer generation (known as self-consistency) or by introducing misleading prompts (induced consistency) to elicit varied responses [30]. A higher degree of consistency across these generated responses is indicative of greater confidence in the model's answer [30]. Empirical studies have demonstrated the practical application of this method. For instance, when LLMs act as evaluators, models like T0 exhibited very low Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) across their own sampled responses, suggesting significant internal uncertainty or variability in their scoring [21]. In contrast, text-davinci-003 showed significantly higher Krippendorff's $\alpha$, implying greater consistency and thus higher reliability in its sampled outputs [21]. Furthermore, adjusting the sampling temperature (T) directly impacts consistency: lower sampling temperatures reduce output diversity and consequently lead to higher IAA, serving as a practical means to influence and quantify response consistency [21].
2.  **Language Model Verbalization**: LLMs can be prompted to directly articulate their confidence levels, for example, by stating a percentage ("I am 20% confident") [25,30]. Alternatively, they can convey lower confidence indirectly through vague, ambiguous, or circuitous responses [30]. This direct communication of confidence helps users gauge the reliability of the model's assertions.
3.  **Token-level Uncertainty Aggregation**: Given that LLMs generate text token by token, each prediction is essentially a classification task with an associated probability distribution [25,30]. The uncertainty of individual token predictions can be calculated from these probability distributions and subsequently aggregated to estimate the overall uncertainty of the complete output [25,30]. This approach provides a granular view of uncertainty that can be rolled up to the sentence or document level.

Beyond these core methods, other frameworks and procedures implicitly or explicitly address uncertainty quantification. For instance, some prediction procedures integrate confidence thresholds: if an LLM's prediction confidence (e.g., the predicted probability for the top class) is high and exceeds a predefined threshold, its prediction is returned; otherwise, the task might be deferred to an alternative, potentially more robust model. This approach relies on the LLM being "well-calibrated" to accurately reflect its certainty [16]. Furthermore, multi-agent configurations like the SoS-ML framework explicitly integrate mechanisms to generate and communicate confidence levels alongside predictions [17]. By allowing interactions among multiple Data Agents (which are essentially ML models with varying hyperparameters), SoS-ML can construct robust confidence intervals as estimates for feature contributions. For example, a specific grouping of diagnostic features achieved a reliance score of 81% with a 95% confidence interval of 75% to 87.5%, thereby providing more robust uncertainty measures compared to single black-box models [17]. The collaborative nature of these agents aims to reduce overall uncertainty and enhance prediction reliability through consensus [17]. In the context of evaluating LLM-generated models, statistical methods such as bootstrapping with replacements (e.g., 1000 redraws on test sets) are employed to ascertain the statistical spread of performance metrics, including means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in model performance evaluation [19].

In conclusion, the quantification of uncertainty is critical for building trustworthy LLM systems, especially in high-stakes domains. The evolution from traditional logit-based methods to more adaptable approaches like consistency-based estimation, direct verbalization, and token-level aggregation, alongside innovative frameworks utilizing confidence thresholds and multi-agent systems, reflects the growing efforts to provide reliable confidence measures [16,17,25,30]. Future research will likely focus on developing more sophisticated, model-agnostic uncertainty estimation techniques that are robust across diverse LLM architectures and applications, further enhancing the transparency and dependability of these powerful models.
### 5.5 Integrated and Causal Explanation Approaches
The pursuit of explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) extends beyond mere output descriptions to a profound understanding of their decision-making processes, thereby fostering trust, enabling robust auditing, and ensuring accountability in their deployment [15,31]. This requires a shift towards **integrated and causal explanation approaches**, which are designed to seamlessly weave together diverse analytical methods to unveil the true underlying mechanisms and dependencies within LLMs. Such approaches recognize that human cognition often prioritizes causal explanations over statistical correlations, seeking to understand "why" an outcome occurred and "what minimal changes" would alter it [11,17].

This section establishes a theoretical framework centered on the imperative for causality and the synergistic integration of various explanation modalities to achieve a comprehensive and verifiable understanding of LLM behaviors. It lays the groundwork for the subsequent detailed explorations of specific methodologies, each contributing a distinct facet to this integrated understanding. The overarching goal is to move beyond superficial interpretations, providing faithful insights into LLM operations that are both actionable for developers and comprehensible for diverse stakeholders.

At its core, the emphasis on **causal explanations** is paramount. Traditional post-hoc explanations, while valuable, often risk being unfaithful rationalizations rather than reflections of the model's true internal causal pathways [15]. To address this, the field is evolving to incorporate methods that can rigorously establish causal dependencies within the model, bridging the gap between observed behaviors and their mechanistic origins [4,11,14,15,18,32]. Frameworks like SAX4BPM and the Causal Dimension within TAXAL exemplify this by embedding "causal process execution views" and faithful reasoning pathways into their design, respectively [4,15]. Similarly, the SoS-ML framework proposes structuring AI explanations as evidence-inference pairs, reflecting a human preference for evidence-based causal narratives [17].

The notion of **integrated approaches** arises from the recognition that no single explanation method can fully capture the complexity of LLMs. Instead, a multi-layered perspective is necessary, combining insights from different vantage points. This includes integrating fine-grained, white-box analyses of internal model components with broader, model-agnostic perspectives that focus on input-output relationships. For instance, NeuroBreak integrates semantic-aware and functionality-aware methods for a deeper mechanistic understanding of LLM security [18], while the InterpretableLLM framework is designed as a multi-layered, integrated system that incorporates various explanation techniques, including causal relationship analysis within reasoning chains [32].

The subsequent sub-sections delve into specific categories of explanation techniques, each contributing a vital piece to this integrated and causal framework:
*   **Attribution-based Explanations** quantify the influence of input features on LLM outputs, offering insights into which parts of the input are most critical for a prediction [8].

Each of these child sections will detail their specific methodologies, discuss their applicability and effectiveness for LLMs, highlight unique contributions, and critically appraise research results, drawing direct connections to the overarching themes of causality and integration. The aim is to illuminate how these diverse yet complementary approaches collectively advance our ability to achieve robust, faithful, and interpretable LLM systems, ultimately building a stronger bridge between LLM complexity and human trust [31]. This integrated perspective also necessitates rigorous validation and the use of technical results and experimental data to substantiate claims and quantify differences, as emphasized by the need for strong evidence of model behavior under manipulation for auditing and compliance [15,31].
#### 5.5.1 Attribution-based Explanations
Attribution-based explanations are fundamental to understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) by quantifying the influence of specific input features, such as words or phrases, on the model's outputs [8,11,13,22]. These methods assign relevance scores to input elements, thereby providing insights into which components are most critical for a particular prediction or generation [13,31].

The field generally categorizes attribution methods into several principal types, applicable to LLMs for explaining local predictions:
1.  **Perturbation-based methods**: These techniques assess feature importance by systematically altering specific input features and observing the corresponding changes in the model's output [10,22,30]. Examples include leave-one-out methods [30] and the use of SNIP scores to identify critical neurons by measuring importance based on localized benign-response prompts [18].
2.  **Gradient-based methods**: These leverage the model's internal structure by calculating the partial derivative of the output with respect to input features. The magnitude of the gradient indicates feature importance [10,22,30,32]. Raw gradients and integrated gradients are common examples, noted for their applicability to LLMs [30]. Gradient-based association analysis can also quantify parameter perturbation propagation to activations, revealing inter-neuron collaboration and causal relationships to safety mechanisms within the model, calculated as $G_{i,j} = \partial a_{\text{down},i}^k / \partial w_{\text{upstream},j}^k$ [18].
3.  **Surrogate models**: This approach involves training a simpler, more interpretable model to approximate the behavior of the complex LLM. The feature importances learned by this surrogate model are then used as explanations for the LLM's decisions [10,22,30]. Prominent examples include LIME and SHAP, which are highlighted for their strong causal tracing capabilities [15,30]. SHAP values, for instance, quantify a feature's influence on a model's output, with absolute values indicating impact and positive values denoting an increased prediction probability [19].
4.  **Decomposition-based techniques**: These methods linearly decompose the output contribution across various input features, assigning relevance scores to input components [10,22,30,32]. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) are examples in this category [30,32].

While methods like LIME and SHAP are powerful for causal tracing, their cognitive clarity can vary significantly with user expertise, necessitating careful consideration for diverse stakeholders [15]. In contrast, some approaches aim for intrinsic faithfulness; for example, Aug-Linear generates "exact" coefficients for each ngram, representing its contribution to a model's prediction and explicitly claiming "considerably more faithful than post hoc methods, such as LIME and SHAP" by being intrinsic to the interpretable model itself [16].

Attribution methods serve as crucial diagnostic tools for LLMs across various applications. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, metrics like "Faithfulness" and "Context Relevancy" function as attribution-based explanations [29]. Faithfulness quantifies the factual consistency of generated answers against retrieved contexts by verifying statements from the answer against the context, penalizing unsubstantiated claims. Context Relevancy attributes how relevant retrieved contexts are to a query, penalizing redundant information [29]. For general LLM behavior diagnosis, attribution scores can be visualized through heatmaps to illustrate input-output word relationships [8,24,32]. The `AMPLIFY` framework leverages post-hoc attribution scores to generate natural language rationales, offering corrective signals for LLMs in complex tasks, while the `Inseq` library facilitates feature attribution for sequence generation models, often visualizing importance scores as heatmaps [24]. Li et al. (2023a) utilized saliency maps to analyze the impact of in-context learning demonstrations on LLM predictions [24].

Case studies from [8] demonstrate the practical utility of attribution for diagnostic tasks:
*   **Assessing Answer Quality**: Attribution can identify passages relied upon by the model, enabling assessment of the answer's quality and source dependency.
*   **Detecting Hallucinations**: By analyzing attribution scores for different parts of speech in instructions, researchers can pinpoint where a model might be fabricating information. Notably, smaller models like Vicuna/Mistral-7B can effectively use attribution to identify hallucinations in larger models such as ChatGPT 3.5 [8].
In a clinical context, ChatGPT ADA employed SHAP analysis to identify and quantify the importance of features (e.g., demographic data, laboratory values, gene variants) contributing to its autonomously generated ML model predictions, with findings verified by data scientists to enhance transparency and trust [19].

For multi-step reasoning, particularly in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories, the **Black-box Resampling method** emerges as an advanced attribution technique designed to quantify the counterfactual influence of individual sentences [3]. This method addresses limitations of traditional approaches, such as underestimating the importance of preceding sentences or the "overdetermination" problem where semantically similar alternatives obscure true influence. Technically, for each sentence $S_i$, two sets of reasoning trajectories are generated: one retaining $S_i$ and another replacing it with a semantically different sentence $T_i$ (cosine similarity < 0.8). The importance of $S_i$ is then quantified by the KL divergence between the final answer distributions generated by these two sets of trajectories, $KL(P_S || P_T)$ [3]. A higher KL divergence signifies greater importance of the original sentence. Empirical results on the MATH dataset showed that planning-related sentences (PG) and uncertainty management sentences (UM) had 2.3 times higher counterfactual importance than active computation (AC) sentences. A specific case highlighted that preserving a key planning sentence (e.g., "convert to decimal to calculate digits") increased accuracy from 40% to 100% [3]. Despite its effectiveness in quantifying influence and addressing overdetermination, a limitation of this black-box approach is that it does not directly reveal internal model mechanisms [3].

While many papers present these core attribution methodologies, several do not delve into more advanced applications such as handling multi-step reasoning, interaction effects, or providing detailed experimental setups and quantitative outcomes beyond general application [30,31,32]. This gap underscores the unique contributions of methods like Black-box Resampling for complex reasoning processes. Future developments in attribution for LLMs will likely focus on improving faithfulness, cognitive clarity for diverse users, and extending capabilities to complex reasoning and dynamic interaction within LLM systems, building upon the foundational techniques discussed.
#### 5.5.2 Internal Module Explanations
Internal module explanations aim to bridge the complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the need for trust by scrutinizing the inner workings of their architectural components, primarily the Transformer's attention mechanisms and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) [15,31]. This approach moves beyond black-box observations to offer a mechanistic understanding of how LLMs process information and arrive at decisions [10,11,12,30]. A high-level conceptualization, such as Functional XAI (fXAI) embodied by the SoS-ML framework, even proposes treating groups of components as "Regions of Interest" (ROIs), analogous to brain areas, to provide transparency at a functional level without necessarily diving into individual neuron analysis [17].

**Attention Mechanisms**

The analysis of attention mechanisms constitutes a fundamental aspect of internal module explanations, revealing how LLMs weigh different parts of their input. Basic approaches often involve "注意力可视化技术" (attention visualization techniques), including "自注意力模式分析" (self-attention pattern analysis), which help in understanding token interactions [11,31,32]. Tools such as the one developed by Vig (2020) provide multi-scale insights for models like BERT and GPT-2, enabling the localization of relevant attention heads and correlating neuron activity with model behavior, thereby assisting in bias detection [24].

More sophisticated methodologies extend beyond basic visualization to "mechanistic interpretability," which involves dissecting the neural network's "circuits" to understand the functional roles of individual neurons and their interconnections [24,25,30]. Wang et al. (2022), for instance, applied circuit analysis and reverse engineering to GPT-2 small to identify the specific roles of attention heads in tasks such as indirect object recognition [24]. Furthermore, research like that by Conmy et al. (2023) focuses on automating these workflows, using algorithms like ACDC to automatically identify subgraphs corresponding to specific model behaviors [24]. The concept of "Circuit Tracing" further aims to reveal computational graphs and functional roles within attention mechanisms, often replacing dense components with sparse, interpretable alternatives to gain mechanistic insights into concept distribution and processing [12]. While the aspiration for Transformer Circuits theory is widely acknowledged, some works note their current analyses do not explicitly delve into it [15,30,31,32], indicating a spectrum of depth in current interpretability efforts.

A prime example of white-box explanation for dynamic reasoning processes is the "Receiver Heads" concept, introduced by a White-box Attention Focusing method [3]. This method aggregates token-level attention matrices into sentence-level matrices and identifies "Receiver Heads" by calculating the kurtosis of attention values for each column (sentence). High-kurtosis heads are indicative of narrow focus on specific sentences, suggesting their role in "broadcasting" key information during reasoning [3]. Empirical findings reveal that these Receiver Heads are predominantly located in deeper model layers (e.g., Layer 36) and exhibit high consistency across various problems (r=.67). Reasoning-specific models demonstrated 1.8 times stronger attention focusing by these heads compared to base models. Crucially, ablation studies showed that deactivating 512 Receiver Heads significantly reduced model accuracy to 28%, a stark contrast to the 37% accuracy observed when random heads were ablated. This quantifies their critical necessity for maintaining robust reasoning integrity [3].

**Feed-Forward Networks**

Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) are recognized as central components for storing and processing internal knowledge within LLMs. Research suggests that FFN structures function as "key-value memories," where the first MLP hidden layer acts as a "key layer" (pattern detectors) and the second MLP hidden layer as a "value layer" (extracting associated values) [8,22]. When an input pattern matches a key layer neuron, it activates, and its corresponding value is propagated to the output, indicating FFNs' role in both detecting and retrieving specific knowledge [22]. Furthermore, a layered specialization has been observed, with lower FFN layers handling surface-level linguistic knowledge (lexical, syntactic) and higher layers storing semantic and factual conceptual knowledge [22]. While this "key-value memories theory" offers deep architectural insights, some papers explicitly state they do not discuss this theory [15,30,31,34].

Mathematically, an FFN block transforms an input vector $x$ into an output vector $y$ as $y = \text{FFN}(x) = f(x \cdot K^\top ) \cdot V = m \cdot V$, which can be interpreted as a neural memory with $dm$ key-value pairs, where $y = \sum _{i=0}^{m-1} m_i \cdot v_i$ [34]. The concept of scaling FFNs with sparsely activated parameters, perhaps through a sparse memory view or Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) networks, is identified as a promising future direction [34].

Neuron-level analysis within FFNs is another key area. "Neuron Activation Analysis" and "probing techniques" are employed to understand the semantic knowledge encoded within these components [10,30]. NeuroBreak, for example, offers detailed explanations of LLM internal mechanisms, particularly in the context of jailbreak attacks, by examining FFNs and their individual neurons [18]. It visualizes the "Layer-wise Semantic Evolution" through dual-stream semantic trajectory graphs and identifies "dedicated safety neurons" based on their parametric alignment and activation dynamics (S+A+, S-A+, S+A-, S-A-) [18]. The "Break the Neurons" function in NeuroBreak allows for interactive causal testing by disabling selected neurons and observing the impact on layer representations, akin to mechanistic interpretability in tracing specific circuits [18]. Efforts to mitigate issues like polysemantic neurons within FFNs, through methods such as PCA decomposition or dictionary learning, are also a recognized area of research [8], though many contemporary works do not explicitly detail such mitigation strategies [15,30,31,34].

**Contributions to LLM Improvement and Future Trajectories**

Insights derived from internal module explanations are not merely for understanding but also directly contribute to improving LLMs. Causal probing and intervention-based tracing, which involve modifying internal variables or input, provide stronger evidence of model behavior under manipulation, enabling debugging and targeted interventions [15]. These interventions can refine model behavior in practical ways, such as editing factual knowledge, enhancing long-context reasoning, reducing hallucinations, and mitigating social bias [15]. Similarly, understanding internal components facilitates model knowledge editing, content control, and pruning [8]. The SoS-ML framework's modular design, emphasizing functional explainability, suggests a future trajectory where inherent transparency guides the development of more responsible AI systems [17]. However, despite these advancements, the application of mechanistic interpretability to LLMs still requires significant in-depth research [30], particularly concerning the need for robust evidence of model behavior under manipulation for auditing and compliance [15]. Future developments are likely to see continued efforts in automating mechanistic interpretability workflows and integrating advanced circuit-level understanding to build more controllable and transparent LLMs.
#### 5.5.3 Sample-based Explanations
Sample-based explanation methods provide critical insights into Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their behavior in response to specific input instances or by quantifying the influence of individual training data points [10,13,25,30,31]. These techniques are fundamental for understanding decision boundaries, identifying causal relationships, assessing robustness, and tracing the provenance of model knowledge. Common approaches within this category include adversarial examples, counterfactual explanations, and data influence methods [13,22].

Among these, **Influence Functions (IF)** stand out for their theoretical promise in quantifying the impact of individual training samples on a model's prediction for a given test sample [8,25,30]. By conceptually simulating the removal and subsequent retraining of the model, IF can reveal which training documents an LLM relies on for its responses, thereby offering insights into its generalization capabilities and potential biases. However, applying IF to LLMs presents significant practical challenges, primarily due to the immense computational cost associated with calculating the Hessian matrix for models with billions of parameters [8]. To mitigate this, approximation techniques have been developed. A notable case study demonstrated the applicability of IF for LLMs using the **EK-FAC approximation** [8]. This method was successfully applied to various pre-trained LLMs, including GPT2-1.5B, LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA2-13B, evaluated on the SciFact dataset. The results indicate that this approximation method effectively recalled original training documents, achieving significantly higher recall rates compared to random selection. Crucially, even with potential overfitting to training data, the recall did not reach 100%, suggesting that LLMs derive knowledge from a broader context beyond single specific training samples, leveraging extensive pre-training knowledge and exhibiting robust generalization capabilities [8].

Complementing IF, **Counterfactual Explanations** offer another powerful sample-based approach. These explanations involve identifying the minimal changes to an input that would alter the model's prediction to a desired outcome [10,11,22,31,32]. By observing how minimal perturbations affect the model's output, counterfactuals illuminate its decision boundaries and dependencies, thereby probing its causal inference capabilities [15,22]. For instance, in real-world applications like public service eligibility, a counterfactual explanation could state, "If your income were below XX, you would qualify," demonstrating the causal link between income and eligibility [15]. Similarly, in AI-assisted hiring, such an explanation might justify a ranking by stating, "Candidate would have ranked higher with X years of experience in Python" [15]. Tools like `Polyjuice`, a counterfactual generator fine-tuned on GPT-2, enable the production of diverse and realistic counterfactuals through controlled perturbation [24]. While counterfactual explanations are valued for their causal faithfulness, a notable limitation is their potential difficulty for non-expert users to interpret [15].

Beyond these, other sample-based methods contribute to understanding LLM behavior. **Adversarial examples**, for instance, involve crafting inputs with slight modifications to test the model's sensitivity and robustness, revealing potential vulnerabilities [10,13,22]. Furthermore, approaches like `NeuroBreak` utilize sample-based analysis by employing successful and unsuccessful jailbreak prompts to observe and explain model behavior related to security vulnerabilities [18]. By comparing neuron activations and layer representations across specific subsets of these prompts, along with "benign-response prompts," `NeuroBreak` offers insights into the internal mechanisms of LLM security [18].

Comparing Influence Functions with counterfactual samples, both methods fundamentally probe an LLM's reliance on specific data points or conditions, but from distinct perspectives [22]. IF focuses on the retrospective analysis of training data's impact on a model's prediction, providing insights into *what* the model learned and *from where*. In contrast, counterfactuals prospectively explore *how* changes in input conditions affect the model's output, revealing its decision-making logic and causal sensitivities. Together, these sample-based explanations offer complementary views, with IF shedding light on the provenance of knowledge and generalization, and counterfactuals elucidating the direct input-output causality and model reasoning. The theoretical promise of IF lies in its ability to pinpoint influential training examples, crucial for debugging, auditing, and understanding knowledge acquisition in LLMs. The practical challenge of computational load is being addressed through approximations like EK-FAC, which make IF feasible for large models, even if not perfectly recalling every training document [8]. Counterfactuals, while powerful for demonstrating "what-if" scenarios and causal effects, face the challenge of interpretability for a broad audience [15]. Future research may explore hybrid methodologies that combine the strengths of both, for example, using counterfactuals to identify critical input features and then applying IF to trace the training data that influenced the model's learned response to those features. This integrated approach could offer a more comprehensive and actionable understanding of LLM behaviors, building a stronger bridge between complexity and trust [31].
#### 5.5.4 Causal and Counterfactual Explanations
Understanding the causal underpinnings of Large Language Model (LLM) decisions is paramount for building trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling effective human-AI collaboration [15,31]. While truth and likelihood are important, human cognition often prioritizes causal explanations over statistical probabilities for their intuitive and satisfying nature [17]. This preference has spurred significant research into both causal and counterfactual explanation techniques for LLMs, aiming to demystify *why* a particular output was generated and *what minimal changes* would alter that outcome. The InterpretableLLM framework explicitly recognizes causal relationship analysis and counterfactual explanation techniques as crucial for deeper explanations and understanding decision boundaries [32].

**Causal Explanations: White-Box and Intervention-Based Approaches**
White-box causal explanation methods focus on dissecting the internal mechanisms of LLMs to directly identify and quantify causal dependencies within their reasoning processes. These approaches typically involve interventions at the neural level, providing fine-grained insights into how specific internal components influence model outputs.

A prominent example is the **Causal Attention Suppression method** introduced by [3]. This technique offers a fine-grained, white-box approach to understand the internal reasoning flow by measuring direct causal dependencies between sentences in an LLM's reasoning trajectory. Technically, it involves masking all attention from subsequent tokens to a target sentence $S_i$. The causal effect is then quantified by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the token probabilities (logits) of subsequent sentences with and without this intervention, i.e., $KL(P_{unintervened} || P_{intervened})$ [3]. Empirical results demonstrated a significant correlation (ρ=.19) between the attention suppression effect and importance scores derived from black-box resampling, particularly for sentences in close proximity (less than 5 sentences apart). A case study further illustrated this by showing that suppressing attention to an intermediate sentence (sentence 12) had the strongest causal effect on a downstream uncertainty management step (sentence 43) [3]. This method provides a direct, mechanistic understanding of how one step causally influences the next in multi-step reasoning.

Beyond attention suppression, other intervention-based methods contribute to white-box causal understanding. The ability to "intervene in model behavior by manipulating specific neural pathways" allows researchers to test and confirm causal dependencies within the LLM's reasoning processes, thereby revealing how internal components affect external outputs [12]. NeuroBreak, for instance, provides strong causal validation capabilities through its "Break the Neurons" function, which allows users to perform causal interventions by disabling selected neurons and observing changes in layer representation or overall model behavior. Furthermore, it employs gradient-based association analysis to quantify causal relationships between upstream and downstream neurons, dissecting the causal flow within the neural network. A case study showed that "breaking neurons in the fourth blue region can cause samples to shift toward the decision boundary, confirming its crucial role in security," illustrating a direct causal impact [18]. Similarly, Boundless DAS (Distributed Alignment Search) identifies interpretable causal structures within LLMs, demonstrated on Alpaca for numerical reasoning problems using interpretable boolean variables [24]. These methods provide unique insights into *how* LLMs arrive at conclusions by directly tracing and manipulating internal causal pathways.

**Counterfactual Explanations: Black-Box and Model-Agnostic Approaches**
In contrast to white-box methods, counterfactual explanations primarily operate as black-box or model-agnostic techniques, focusing on input-output relationships to infer causality. They identify minimal modifications to an input that would alter a model's prediction, thereby probing decision boundaries and revealing what aspects of the input are causally responsible for a given output [11,13,22,32]. This approach directly assesses causal dependencies by demonstrating how changes in input cause changes in prediction, offering actionable insights aligned with human thinking (e.g., "If your income were higher, your loan would be approved") [17].

Counterfactuals are considered a type of example-based local explanation [30,31], useful for algorithmic recourse. Tools like Polyjuice generate realistic counterfactuals for LLMs [30]. The TAXAL framework highlights counterfactual explanations for their crucial role in providing auditability and contestability across various domains, such as explaining legal outcomes or medical diagnoses through "what if" scenarios (e.g., "If the ECG had not shown ST-elevation, the diagnosis would shift to unstable angina") [15]. The SAX4BPM framework also emphasizes generating "causally sound" explanations, incorporating a "causal process execution view" to provide insights into *why* a condition occurred in a business process context [4]. These black-box methods offer a practical way to understand the robustness of an LLM's reasoning and the critical features driving its decisions.

**Synthesis and Distinct Contributions**
The "causal attention suppression" method and other white-box causal interventions offer a unique perspective by directly exposing the internal, fine-grained flow of reasoning within LLMs. By manipulating attention mechanisms or specific neural pathways, these methods provide a mechanistic understanding of *how* LLMs process information and reach conclusions, which is particularly valuable for understanding complex multi-step reasoning. They directly establish causal links between internal states or computational steps.

In contrast, counterfactual samples provide a more external, model-agnostic view. While they effectively test the model's causal inference capabilities by demonstrating input-output dependencies [10,22], they primarily reveal *what input features* are important for a decision and *how changes to these features* would alter the outcome. This implies a causal relationship at the input-output level but does not directly illuminate the internal neural computations that mediate this relationship. For instance, counterfactuals can show that changing a single word negates a prediction, but causal attention suppression can pinpoint *which internal attention patterns* were responsible for processing that word's influence.

Despite their methodological differences, these approaches are complementary. The observed correlation between causal attention suppression and black-box resampling methods [3] suggests that internal causal mechanisms often align with external input-output sensitivities. White-box methods provide detailed diagnostic power for understanding internal behavior, while black-box counterfactuals offer actionable insights for users and validate model robustness by probing decision boundaries.

**LLM's Own Causal Reasoning Capabilities**
Beyond explaining LLM decisions, a separate but related research direction investigates LLMs' inherent capabilities for causal reasoning. Studies by Gao et al. (2022) examined ChatGPT's performance on tasks such as Event Causality Identification (ECI), Causal Discovery (CD), and Causal Explanation Generation (CEG) [24]. They found that while ChatGPT could effectively generate causal explanations, its actual causal reasoning ability was limited, frequently exhibiting "causal hallucination" and being highly sensitive to prompt structure and wording [24]. Nevertheless, LLMs can provide implicit causal inferences, as seen in ChatGPT ADA's natural language explanation for its imputation strategy in clinical datasets, where it states "making zero-imputation *align with this understanding*", reflecting a causal inference about data semantics [19]. The "Guardian" persona in AI-assisted research review also implicitly relies on causal reasoning by scrutinizing whether experimental evidence truly supports the conclusions, questioning the validity of causal links asserted by authors [9]. The integration of social and causal reasoning within AI explanations is also crucial, as contextual explanations are viewed as a subset of social explanations overlapping with causal ones [17].

Overall, the field is moving towards a more holistic understanding of LLM explainability by combining both fine-grained internal causal analysis with robust external counterfactual testing. Future research will likely continue to explore robust causal inference methods, improve the generation of actionable counterfactuals, and address the challenges of LLMs' intrinsic causal reasoning capabilities.
#### 5.5.5 Explainable Prompting Techniques
Explainable prompting techniques represent a crucial avenue for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by intrinsically guiding them to produce understandable outputs [8]. This approach leverages LLMs' inherent language generation capabilities to include reasoning steps or structured justifications within their responses, thereby offering insights into their decision-making processes [8,11].

A primary and widely adopted explainable prompting technique is **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**. CoT guides LLMs to generate intermediate, step-by-step reasoning sequences before arriving at a final answer, which is believed to both increase transparency and improve task performance [10,13,15,22,25,30,32,33]. This explicit reasoning path allows users to trace the model's thinking, making the decision process more transparent [22]. The effectiveness of CoT lies in its ability to facilitate complex logical thinking and reasoning, often improving performance in tasks that require multi-step inference [24,33]. For instance, SCIENCEQA uses a CoT process to train LLMs to generate explanations, which significantly enhances reasoning abilities and question-answering performance [24]. Furthermore, variations such as Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) improve question answering by prompting LLMs to engage in meta-reasoning across multiple inference chains, selecting relevant facts for better explanations, particularly in multi-hop QA scenarios [24]. Another approach, "Rethinking with Retrieval," integrates CoT prompts to generate reasoning paths refined with external knowledge, leading to more accurate and reliable explanations [24].

Despite its widely recognized benefits, a critical concern regarding CoT explanations centers on their **fidelity**—whether the generated reasoning accurately reflects the LLM's true internal mechanistic reasoning. Several studies critically note that CoT explanations "can be systematically unfaithful" and may not genuinely reflect the model's underlying processes [22,24,30]. This raises a fundamental challenge: CoT outputs might function more as post-hoc rationalizations or "exoplanations" rather than true causal paths of the model's decision-making, potentially creating a misleading sense of transparency [7,15]. Research has even shown that newer LLMs might refuse to generate outputs based on deliberately manipulated, erroneous CoT chains, suggesting a nuanced relationship between CoT and internal logic, while older, larger LLMs demonstrated better CoT fidelity in specific cases [8]. This fidelity gap underscores the necessity for robust methods to validate the trustworthiness of CoT-generated explanations.

To address the fidelity concern and deepen the understanding of CoT steps, the concept of "**Thought Anchors**" has been proposed. This rigorous approach leverages CoT prompting as a foundation by externalizing intermediate reasoning steps but further enhances explainability by identifying which of these generated steps are truly critical for the final outcome [3]. By pinpointing these high-influence sentences, Thought Anchors help users understand *why* a particular CoT leads to a specific answer and *how* the model structures its reasoning, offering a method to validate the importance of individual reasoning components [3].

Beyond CoT, other explainable prompting techniques focus on structuring and contextualizing LLM outputs for enhanced interpretability. **LLM Evaluation** serves as a prime example, where carefully designed prompts guide the LLM to not only perform an evaluation but also to provide explicit justifications for its judgments [8,21]. For instance, LLMs can be instructed to judge text quality based on specific criteria and provide an accompanying explanation for the assigned score, significantly increasing transparency in the evaluation process [29]. This method offers "scalability and explainability," although human verification of the output remains crucial, and performance can vary in domain-specific tasks [29].

Furthermore, prompts can be engineered to elicit **dynamic and human-centered explanations**. LLMs can generate context-aware explanations by understanding user questions and transforming model outputs into narratives aligned with user cognition, as demonstrated in medical risk assessment scenarios [11]. **Instruction prompts** are vital for guiding LLMs to adhere to specific output requirements and enhance interpretability. In specialized applications like DocOA, instruction prompts ensure the LLM provides "evidence-based medical insights," avoids speculation, states limitations, and tailors explanations to specific audiences (e.g., patients or professionals), thereby significantly improving audience-tailored interpretability [20]. Similarly, **persona-based prompting**, such as defining LLM personas like the Guardian, Synthesizer, and Innovator, guides models to produce "distinct analytical viewpoints" and structured critique forms, making outputs more interpretable by ensuring specific types of analysis are consistently provided [9]. Variations in prompts, including persona-based instructions, have also been shown to influence an LLM's scoring behavior and explanations, though core evaluative judgments may remain robust [21].

The concept of "guard-railing" LLM performance through specific input implicitly acts as an explainable prompting technique, shaping the LLM to produce explanations with desired characteristics and improved perceived fidelity [4]. Moreover, frameworks like SoS-ML leverage fine-tuned LLMs as a Language Acquisition Device (LAD) to translate structured inference-evidence pairs into comprehensible, natural language explanation logs, providing structured sections for different user groups (e.g., end-users, developers, interested parties) [17]. Even within traditional interpretable models, prompting LLMs can enhance explainability; for example, Aug-Tree uses prompts to expand ngrams in decision tree splits, creating more robust and interpretable individual splits by representing concrete concepts. Human evaluation confirmed the high semantic quality of these LLM-generated expansions, with average scores consistently above 4 on a 1-5 scale [16].

In summary, explainable prompting techniques, ranging from the foundational CoT to structured instruction and persona-based methods, offer natural ways to generate explanations that enhance transparency and often improve performance. While CoT's fidelity remains a critical point of contention, advanced techniques like Thought Anchors aim to address this by validating reasoning steps. The application of explainable prompting extends to areas like LLM evaluation, dynamic explanation generation, and even augmenting traditional interpretable models, highlighting a versatile and evolving landscape for increasing LLM interpretability [15,31]. Future research should continue to refine methods for systematically evaluating the trustworthiness and causal alignment of prompted explanations, especially considering the distinction between 'explanations' and genuine 'internal reasoning' [7].
#### 5.5.6 Decomposing Complex Reasoning Pathways
The intricate nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) often renders their decision-making processes opaque, necessitating robust explainability techniques to foster trust and enable effective debugging [31]. Decomposing complex reasoning pathways into understandable components is a crucial step towards this goal. While general approaches emphasize tracing reasoning paths, a state-of-the-art technique for explaining multi-step LLM reasoning is the concept of "Thought Anchors" [3]. Other frameworks also contribute to this decomposition, either through structural design or by analyzing reasoning chains.

**Thought Anchors: Dissecting LLM Internal Reasoning**

Thought Anchors are defined as pivotal sentences within an LLM's reasoning trajectory that exert a disproportionate influence on subsequent steps and the final outcome, representing critical junctures where the model makes significant decisions [3]. The identification and analysis of these anchors offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and intervening in LLM reasoning.

The methodology for identifying Thought Anchors is systematized through a combination of sentence classification and three distinct attribution methods [3]:
*   **Sentence Classification System**: To systematically analyze reasoning trajectories, sentences are categorized into eight types: Problem Setup, Plan Generation (PG), Fact Retrieval (FR), Active Computation (AC), Uncertainty Management (UM), Result Consolidation, Self Checking (SC), and Final Answer Emission. This classification, often automated by an LLM, provides a structured lens for examining the roles of different reasoning steps [3].
*   **Attribution Methods**:
    1.  **Black-box Resampling Method**: This technique quantifies the counterfactual influence of a sentence by replacing it with a semantically distinct alternative and measuring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the final answer distribution. Sentences whose alteration critically impacts the outcome are highlighted as important [3].
    2.  **White-box Attention Focusing ("Receiver Heads")**: This method identifies specific attention heads that consistently focus on important sentences across various reasoning steps. These "Receiver Heads" are indicative of the model's internal mechanism for "broadcasting" or emphasizing key information, suggesting a structured internal processing of anchors [3].
    3.  **Causal Attention Suppression Method**: By masking the attention of a given sentence and observing changes in downstream token logits, this method directly measures its causal impact on subsequent reasoning steps, revealing explicit causal links and dependencies [3].

This unique combination of black-box (resampling), white-box (attention focusing), and causal (attention suppression) methods provides a robust, triangulated validation of Thought Anchors, offering a comprehensive approach to dissecting LLM reasoning at a sentence level of abstraction [3].

**Key Findings and Implications for LLM Improvement**:

Research using Thought Anchors has yielded significant insights [3]:
*   **Differential Importance of Sentence Types**: High-level organizational sentences, such as Plan Generation (PG) and Uncertainty Management (UM), were found to have significantly higher influence compared to low-level Active Computation (AC) sentences. Specifically, PG and UM sentences exhibited 2.3 times more counterfactual importance and 4 times more receiver head attention than AC sentences. This indicates that LLMs heavily rely on strategic and self-correction steps to guide their reasoning, rather than merely performing explicit calculations [3].
*   **Role of "Receiver Heads"**: "Receiver Heads" in deeper layers actively and consistently focus on anchor sentences, forming modular reasoning "blocks." Ablating these specific heads severely degrades model accuracy ($28\%$ vs. $37\%$ for random ablation), confirming their vital role in coherent reasoning [3].
*   **Debugging and Error Correction**: Thought Anchors play a crucial role in error correction and guiding path redirection within reasoning, making them critical intervention points for improving model reliability. A case study demonstrated how specific PG and UM sentences could redirect an incorrect calculation towards the correct answer by prompting verification and correcting conceptual errors [3]. The generalizability of these findings has been validated across different LLM models, such as DeepSeek and Llama [3].

**Comparison with Other Decomposition Approaches**

While Thought Anchors provide a granular, empirically validated method for identifying critical internal reasoning steps, other approaches also address the decomposition of complex LLM behaviors:

*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Explanations**: The "推理链解释模块" (Reasoning Chain Explanation Module) within frameworks like InterpretableLLM aims to explain "模型的推理过程和中间步骤" (the model's reasoning process and intermediate steps) by generating natural language "思维链解释" (Chain-of-Thought explanations) [32]. However, this approach generally focuses on visualizing or articulating intermediate steps without the specific methodology of sentence classification or the detailed, triangulated attribution methods employed by Thought Anchors to identify truly *critical* steps [32]. Thought Anchors offer a deeper analytical layer beyond simply sequential narration. [32]
*   **Agentic and Modular Systems**: The SoS-ML framework offers a different paradigm, decomposing complex reasoning pathways through a modular, multi-agent architecture. Tasks are broken down and handled by specialized Data Agents that process subsets of data or specific tasks, interacting through Interaction Platforms and System Agents to synthesize decisions [17]. For example, a Q-Learning Agent dynamically selects optimal combinations of agents (e.g., Color, Intensity, Edge Processors for image interpretation), thereby explaining how different features contribute to the interpretation based on context [17]. This represents a *structural decomposition* of the system itself into explainable functional units, contrasting with Thought Anchors' analysis of an individual LLM's generated reasoning trajectory. Similarly, LLM-based evaluators implicitly demonstrate decomposition by guiding the LLM through a structured series of logical steps for complex tasks like code evaluation (e.g., parsing input, checking syntax, static analysis, evaluating readability) [29]. This approach decomposes the *input task prompt* to elicit a structured response, rather than introspecting the LLM's internal reasoning process for spontaneously generated CoT.
*   **Mechanistic Interpretability and Diagnostic Tools**: Research in mechanistic interpretability aims to decompose and understand multi-step processes by tracing the neural circuits involved in complex LLM behaviors, such as planning ahead in poetry generation or performing mathematical calculations [12]. This operates at a lower, neural-level abstraction compared to Thought Anchors' sentence-level analysis. Furthermore, general discussions around "diagnostic tools" and "debugging interfaces" highlight the need to surface faulty reasoning traces and expose hidden dependencies, mentioning techniques like "causal mediation analysis" to isolate components that drive decisions [15]. While acknowledging the value of such analysis for providing stronger evidence of model behavior, these discussions typically lack the specific, detailed methodology for sentence-level decomposition offered by Thought Anchors [15].

**Future Development Trajectories**

The field of decomposing complex LLM reasoning pathways stands to benefit from several future directions. Integrating Thought Anchors with mechanistic interpretability could bridge the gap between abstract sentence-level insights and low-level neural circuit dynamics, offering multi-layered explanations. Further refinement and automation of the sentence classification system, perhaps leveraging few-shot learning or more sophisticated LLM prompting, could enhance its scalability and accuracy. Applying Thought Anchors for targeted fine-tuning, knowledge editing, or safety interventions presents a promising avenue for improving LLM robustness and controllability. Moreover, exploring how modular agentic systems could leverage anchor identification for improved self-correction mechanisms or dynamic task allocation could lead to more inherently explainable and reliable AI systems. Ultimately, these decomposition techniques are crucial for transforming LLMs from black boxes into transparent, debuggable, and trustworthy agents.
### 5.6 Explainable Human-AI System Design and Frameworks
Explainable Human-AI System Design and Frameworks represent a critical paradigm shift towards embedding transparency and interpretability directly into the architecture and interaction mechanisms of Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Moving beyond post-hoc explanations, this approach emphasizes creating systems where explainability is an inherent design principle, fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and facilitating effective human oversight in complex and high-stakes domains [11,15,17,31]. 

**Explainable Human-AI System Design Strategies**

| Strategy                          | Description                                                              | Key Elements/Approaches                                   | Goal for Explainability                                   |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persona-based AI Agents**       | LLMs adopt distinct roles/communication styles for explanations.         | Guardian, Synthesizer, Innovator (peer review); role-sensitive adaptation | Tailored insights, diverse analytical viewpoints        |
| **Structured Output Generation**  | Transforms free-form LLM outputs into clear, consistent formats.         | Hierarchical logs, component-based attribution, knowledge integration | Clarity, consistency, auditable insights                |
| **Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration** | Integrates human expertise/judgment with LLM analytical power.         | Division of labor, real-time feedback, interactive designs | Trustworthy decisions, effective human oversight        |

This section explores three interconnected strategies that contribute to this overarching goal: designing LLM agents with distinct personas, generating structured outputs for enhanced clarity, and establishing hybrid human-AI collaboration models.

The first strategy, **Persona-based AI Agents for Explainability**, focuses on enhancing interpretability by enabling LLMs to adopt distinct roles or communication styles. This allows for the breakdown of complex tasks into manageable, interpretable components and the tailoring of explanations to suit the cognitive and epistemic needs of diverse stakeholders [15,17]. By providing adaptable and often multi-perspective analytical viewpoints, this approach enriches the depth and relevance of explanations.

The second strategy, **Structured Output Generation for Enhanced Transparency**, addresses the inherent complexity of LLM decision-making by transforming opaque, free-form natural language explanations into clear, consistent, and auditable formats [11,31]. This not only reduces cognitive load for human users but also facilitates automated processing and verification, thereby bolstering trust and verifiability in AI outputs. Various techniques, from hierarchical explanation logs to component-based attribution and knowledge-integrated structuring, are employed to achieve this enhanced clarity [15,17].

Complementing these, **Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration Models** integrate human expertise and judgment directly into the AI workflow, leveraging the complementary strengths of both humans and LLMs. This approach optimizes for interpretability and accuracy by strategically dividing labor, allowing LLMs to handle time-consuming analytical tasks while empowering human experts for critical thinking, oversight, and final judgment [4,16,17]. Emphasizing real-time human feedback and interactive designs, these models foster a dynamic, adaptive dialogue between humans and AI, essential for trustworthy decision-making [14,31].

Collectively, these three design philosophies — persona-based tailoring, structured information delivery, and integrated human-AI partnership — articulate a cohesive vision for explainable LLMs. They underscore a unified commitment to human-centric design, systematic decomposition of complexity, and the proactive integration of explainability from conception to deployment. Future research in this area is poised to further refine these methodologies, focusing on standardizing design principles, empirically quantifying their impact on user trust and understanding, and fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure that LLM explainability evolves in alignment with human values and practical needs.
#### 5.6.1 Persona-based AI Agents for Explainability
Persona-based AI agents represent a significant advancement in enhancing the explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by designing systems where LLMs assume distinct roles or communication styles. This approach facilitates the breakdown of complex tasks into interpretable components, tailors explanations to diverse user needs, and integrates multiple analytical perspectives to achieve holistic understanding [9,15,17].

A fundamental aspect of persona-based design is the adoption of role-sensitive explanation strategies, which dynamically adapt to the cognitive and epistemic needs of different stakeholders. The TAXAL framework, for instance, champions "Explanation Role Routing," where explanation granularity and focus are adjusted based on user profiles. This is exemplified in medical contexts, distinguishing between "Doctor-Centered Explanation" and "Patient-Centered Explanation" with divergent cognitive, functional, and causal emphases to provide distinct analytical viewpoints [15]. Similarly, the DocOA system tailors its final outputs and communication style, such as adopting a "professional and informative tone suitable for medical discussions" for healthcare professionals versus a more accessible style for patients, through instruction prompts that guide the model to adopt appropriate personas [20]. This user-centric adaptation also extends to educational settings, where LLMs can adjust their language and style to be more approachable for students, thereby increasing comfort and interpretability compared to traditional human instructors [28]. These instances primarily represent single-persona adaptation, where a single LLM adjusts its output style or content based on the target audience.

In contrast, multi-persona approaches involve assigning multiple distinct LLM agents specialized roles to generate diverse and structured analytical viewpoints, often for more complex tasks. A prominent example is the "LLM Triumvirate" in re-engineered peer review systems, comprising a Guardian (skeptical expert), a Synthesizer (panoramic view of research), and an Innovator (hyper-focused on novelty) [9]. Each persona is "programmed with a prompt" to fulfill its specific function, collectively providing "three distinct analytical viewpoints" that contribute to a more transparent and interpretable evaluation for human Associate Editors [9]. This system demonstrates how complementary perspectives, and potentially even adversarial analytical viewpoints, can be systematically managed and integrated to offer a comprehensive explanation. Another multi-persona framework is SoS-ML, which utilizes "Concept Agents"—specialized ML models or scripts that embody specific roles akin to personas. These agents are designed to approximate human understanding of concepts and facilitate the incorporation of human feedback and domain knowledge. By modularizing functions, Concept Agents can generate diverse analytical viewpoints, such as conducting gender-specific analysis in certain scenarios, and transform technical inferences into "Contextual Explanation_AI" for human end-users [17]. This modular and role-based decomposition inherently breaks down complex problems into manageable, explainable components.

While the efficacy of persona-based prompting in influencing LLM behavior is evident in tailoring communication and analytical focus, empirical studies provide nuanced insights into its quantitative impact. Research into assigning a persona to an LLM evaluator, such as instructing it to act as a "human worker," revealed "minor changes in absolute scores" for evaluation tasks. However, this persona assignment did not fundamentally alter the relative ranking of texts, suggesting that while personas can modulate scoring behavior, they might not fundamentally change core evaluative judgments [21]. It is also critical to note the distinction between explicit persona assignment and implicit role-sensitive strategies; the TAXAL framework, despite strongly advocating for "role-sensitive" and "stakeholder-aware" explanations, does not explicitly employ the term "persona-based AI agents" in its core proposals, although it acknowledges external work that does [15]. This highlights a subtle terminological and conceptual difference within the field regarding the formalization of "persona."

Looking ahead, the development of persona-based AI agents offers promising avenues for enhancing LLM explainability by systematically integrating diverse analytical viewpoints and adapting explanations to contextual needs [31]. Future research could focus on empirically quantifying the impact of different persona designs on user trust and understanding, exploring more sophisticated mechanisms for managing and synthesizing potentially adversarial or conflicting insights from multiple personas, and standardizing the design principles for creating effective persona-based agentic LLMs.
#### 5.6.2 Structured Output Generation for Enhanced Transparency
The generation of structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a pivotal approach to enhancing explainability, moving beyond opaque, free-form natural language explanations to provide clarity, consistency, and interpretability for diverse users [15,31]. This methodology addresses the inherent complexity of LLM decision-making by presenting insights in a format that facilitates human comprehension, supports informed decision-making, and enables subsequent automated processing. The fundamental benefit lies in transforming subjective or implicitly reasoned LLM outputs into verifiable and auditable data, thereby fostering greater trust and transparency in AI systems [31].

Structured outputs enhance human comprehension by reducing cognitive load and presenting information in an organized manner. For instance, the medical example illustrates how an LLM can convert complex insights into a consistent, transparent format, detailing specific risk factors with quantified weights (e.g., high cholesterol history +37% risk, family history +28%, BMI +15%) for a patient's hypertension risk [11]. This precise numerical breakdown aids doctors in understanding prediction bases. Similarly, in research review processes, LLMs can populate standardized review forms, transforming subjective essays into structured datasets that significantly enhance feedback clarity, consistency, and interpretability [9]. For automated processing, structured outputs provide machine-readable formats, such as the intermediary Python code generated by ChatGPT ADA, which allows human experts to review and verify the steps taken by the LLM, contributing to debugging and trust, even when the underlying LLM remains a black box [19].

Various techniques are employed to achieve structured output generation, each impacting explainability criteria differently:

One prominent technique involves **hierarchical and multi-audience explanation logs**. The SoS-ML framework exemplifies this by generating structured explanation logs with distinct sections tailored for different stakeholders: an "Overview for AI end-users" for decision purpose and main inference, "System Information for AI Developers" detailing data agents and contexts, and an "Appendix for Interested Parties" with detailed evidence and system change logs [17]. This multi-layered approach ensures clarity, consistency, and verifiability across a spectrum of consumers. In a similar vein, the TaxAL framework advocates for "layered explanation interfaces" that offer tiered explanation formats, such as surface-level rationales for end-users and in-depth causal traces for auditors, acknowledging the varied information needs of different users [15]. While TaxAL emphasizes the *adaptability* and *layering* of explanations based on stakeholder needs, its critical analysis highlights that it does not explicitly detail methods for converting free-form text into standardized structured data formats, focusing more on the *purpose* rather than the *mechanisms* of structuring [15]. This contrasts with SoS-ML, which provides a concrete framework for generating such logs.

Another approach focuses on **component-based and attributional structuring**, breaking down decisions into identifiable or quantifiable elements. Aug-Linear, for instance, explicitly produces a "dictionary of coefficients" for each ngram, providing a structured, human-readable output that allows for "complete inspection of a model’s decision-making process" and enables users to "audit the model with prior knowledge" [16]. Similarly, specialized LLMs like DocOA utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to dynamically pull relevant data and "identify the source on which the generated answer was based," linking answers to specific, high-quality clinical evidence and corresponding references. This explicit sourcing acts as a structured output, allowing users to verify the rationale and accuracy of medical responses [20]. The InterpretableLLM framework also implicitly leverages this by generating "detailed explanations" in medical diagnosis, "risk score explanations" detailing key influencing factors in finance, and legal analysis citing specific clauses and precedents [32].

**Knowledge-integrated and rule-driven structuring** further enhances transparency. Pan et al. (2023) proposed enhancing LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs to improve performance and explainability, implying that internal structured data can lead to more transparent outputs [24]. For decision-tree based models like Aug-Tree, the decision tree structure itself provides an inherently structured representation of the model's logic, where each node's split condition, augmented by LLM-generated ngrams, is clearly defined for transparency [16]. Beyond textual outputs, visual structuring can also provide significant insights. NeuroBreak’s visual interface transforms complex internal LLM analysis into structured visual outputs, such as the "multi-layer radial layout" for Neuron View, categorizing neurons into distinct functional regions to organize understanding of neuron functionality and collaboration, thereby reducing cognitive load [18].

Furthermore, **hybrid and specialized formats** integrate various structured elements. In LLM evaluation tasks, while the LLM generates natural language, specific parsing rules are applied to convert it into a structured numerical rating (e.g., a 5-level Likert scale, sometimes with 0.5 increments), enhancing interpretability and comparability [21]. The output of an LLM evaluator often includes both a numerical "SCORE" and a textual "EXPLANATION," forming a structured format that provides both quantitative assessment and human-readable justification [29]. This provides a clear understanding of specific issues, such as invalid syntax or made-up functions in code generation [29]. LLMs can also be leveraged to reformat complex, numerical results from traditional XAI algorithms into user-friendly textual descriptions, significantly improving their comprehensibility [8].

While the benefits of structured output are widely acknowledged, the field presents nuanced differences in implementation and focus. Some works, such as the comprehensive review on LLM explainability, highlight a gap, stating they "do not describe methods or frameworks that explicitly convert LLM-generated free-form text into standardized, structured data formats" [30]. This underscores the ongoing challenge of effectively transforming the inherently generative nature of LLMs into rigorously structured formats. In contrast, frameworks like SoS-ML provide explicit mechanisms for this conversion, with a fine-tuned LLM (LAD) converting internal inference-evidence pairs into structured logs [17]. The emphasis on "human-interpretable explanations" in frameworks like SAX4BPM implicitly points towards the need for structured outputs, even if not explicitly detailed [4].

In summary, the evolution towards structured output generation for LLM explainability marks a significant advancement. By moving from unstructured prose to formats like layered logs, quantified attributions, linked evidence, decision trees, and numerical scores, researchers are systematically improving transparency, interpretability, and trust. Future developments will likely focus on standardizing these structuring techniques, improving the robustness of natural language parsing into structured formats, and further integrating external knowledge sources to provide even more precise and verifiable explanations. This progression will be critical for enabling wider adoption of LLMs in high-stakes domains where accountability and clarity are paramount.
#### 5.6.3 Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration Models
Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration Models represent a pivotal paradigm shift in the pursuit of explainable Large Language Models (LLMs), moving beyond purely algorithmic transparency to integrate human expertise and judgment into the AI workflow. This approach seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of both humans and LLMs, aiming for explainability that is not only efficient but also trustworthy, especially in high-stakes domains [2,6,17,31,32]. The core rationale is to allow LLMs to perform time-consuming analytical tasks and generate preliminary explanations, thereby freeing human experts to focus on critical thinking, final judgment, strategic direction, and creative insights [9,19,28]. This framework fundamentally shifts the role of explainable AI (XAI) from merely static visualization to an "adaptive, trustworthy dialogue embedded in sociotechnical systems" [15].

A key commonality across these models is the strategic division of labor, optimizing for both interpretability and accuracy. For instance, the Aug-Linear approach prioritizes transparent and efficient predictions from simpler models for "easy samples," reserving powerful yet opaque black-box LLMs only for "difficult samples" [16]. This mechanism maximizes interpretability for a substantial portion of data while maintaining overall accuracy, allowing human experts to concentrate on challenging cases where the black-box model's output requires deeper scrutiny. Similarly, in NLP system development, LLM evaluations are proposed for quick, low-cost quality assessment, with human evaluation reserved for essential feedback before actual deployment, leveraging LLMs for efficiency and reproducibility and humans for nuanced understanding and critical thinking [21]. This principle extends to various applications, where LLMs "accelerate the coding process" and "speed up routine tasks," but human oversight remains paramount for interpreting LLM-generated code, detecting errors, and understanding context [28].

Human oversight and the integration of feedback are central tenets of these hybrid models. The SoS-ML framework explicitly advocates for real-time human feedback, allowing the system to continuously adapt and refine its predictions. Its "Concept Agents" are designed to integrate human feedback and domain knowledge, acting as "scaffolding" to guide learning and explanation processes [17]. A practical example from SoS-ML demonstrates AI agents consulting human experts to identify and address gender bias in salary prediction, providing "testament" and caution notifications to empower human experts with evidence for final judgment [17]. In medical diagnosis, financial risk assessment, and legal analysis, LLM explanations are designed to help human experts like doctors, bankers, and lawyers make "more informed decisions," reinforcing a collaborative model where AI supports rather than replaces human judgment [32]. The DocOA model, for instance, involves physicians actively assessing LLM outputs for quality and reasoning, facilitating human evaluation of AI's rationale and accuracy, particularly by identifying clinical evidence and references [20]. For LLM-based evaluators, a "human in the loop is still required to verify the output generated by the model," especially for complex or domain-specific tasks [29].

Furthermore, interaction design in these hybrid models promotes transparency and accountability. The SAX4BPM framework integrates human-engineered knowledge with LLM synthesis, and its rigorous user studies on perception (trust, curiosity, interpretability) highlight its design for human oversight and interaction [4]. The Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD) introduced by Kang et al. (2023) exemplifies a hybrid approach where LLMs generate hypotheses and clear explanations for debugging decisions, augmenting human developers' capabilities [24]. Similarly, NeuroBreak, a hybrid human-AI collaboration model for revealing LLM jailbreaking mechanisms, combines automated pattern mining with human-centered interfaces, allowing experts to dynamically explore security mechanisms and identify vulnerabilities through the system's "explanation engine" and "visual interface" [18]. The importance of functional explanations in enhancing workflow usability and stakeholder alignment is underscored by the notion that explanations should enable human users to "challenge or refine outputs through counterfactuals and interactive rationales" [15].

While the conceptual basis for human-AI collaboration is strong, with XAI supporting "human interaction, trust calibration, and decision assurance" and facilitating "cooperative reasoning" [15], some frameworks lack detailed specific "mechanisms for human verification and critical thinking regarding LLM outputs" beyond general interaction and auditing capabilities [15]. Future development trajectories must emphasize a deeper "human-centered perspective" to understand "how people process, interact with, and make use of information" from LLMs [2]. This necessitates increased interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together experts from diverse fields, such as medical professionals and AI developers, or AI experts and regulatory bodies, to design more effective and trustworthy XAI systems [14,31]. Such collaborations are crucial for integrating ethical compliance and cognitive science insights, ensuring that human values and critical thinking remain central in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, these hybrid models mark a critical step towards fostering accountability and building trust in LLM applications by ensuring that human judgment remains the ultimate arbiter, informed and enhanced by AI's analytical prowess.
### 5.7 Domain-Specific Explainable LLM Architectures and Benchmarking
The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes, specialized domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services necessitates a profound shift from generalized capabilities to domain-specific explainability. This transition is crucial because generic LLMs often lack the precision, verifiability, and contextual nuance required by expert systems, potentially leading to inaccurate or 'nonsensical' outputs for specialized tasks [11,33]. Consequently, the focus has shifted towards developing tailored LLM architectures and rigorous benchmarking frameworks that can meet the stringent demands for trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance inherent in these critical sectors [24,34].

This section outlines the strategies employed to imbue LLMs with domain expertise and the essential methodologies for evaluating their explainability and performance in specialized contexts. The first aspect involves **tailoring LLMs for domain-specific explainability**, exploring various architectural and adaptation strategies. This includes methods such as specialized prompt engineering to elicit accurate and relevant responses [28,30], the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding models in external knowledge bases and providing evidence-based reasoning [8,20], and the incorporation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to inject structured domain knowledge and mitigate issues like hallucination [24]. Furthermore, bespoke LLM architectures, fine-tuned models, and modular, context-aware frameworks (e.g., SoS-ML, Aug-imodels, NeuroBreak) are being developed to offer deeper intrinsic understanding and tailored explanation generation, aligning with specific domain requirements and user needs [16,34]. The design of explanations themselves is also tailored to reflect domain-specific constraints and the diverse needs of stakeholders, as highlighted by frameworks like TAXAL [2,31].

The second, equally critical aspect addresses **domain-specific benchmarking for clinical and expert systems**. Generalized evaluation metrics prove inadequate for assessing LLM performance in these sensitive environments, necessitating specialized frameworks that account for context-specific nuances, regulatory demands, and ethical considerations [24,34]. This involves the development of tailored datasets (e.g., WHOOPS!, SCIENCEQA, ROSCOE, MATH), rule-based metrics, and novel benchmark frameworks that evaluate not only output correctness but also the quality of reasoning, explainability, and adherence to domain principles [18,29]. Crucially, the integration of human experts—ranging from physicians to AI security specialists—is indispensable in these evaluation processes, providing vital validation for model reliability, assessing the clinical utility of outputs, and ensuring explanations are comprehensible and aligned with real-world practices [19,20]. Despite progress, a significant challenge remains in the absence of comprehensive standardization for these domain specialization strategies, emphasizing the ongoing need for robust, adaptive, and human-centered evaluation frameworks for explainable LLMs in expert domains [34].
#### 5.7.1 Tailoring LLMs for Domain-Specific Explainability
The inherent generality of Large Language Models (LLMs), while enabling broad applicability, frequently poses significant challenges when deployed in specialized domains that demand precision, verifiability, and contextual nuance [11,33]. The necessity for tailoring LLMs arises from their potential to miss domain-specific knowledge, generate inaccurate or 'nonsensical' outputs for less common analytical methods, and the critical need for explainability in high-stakes environments such as healthcare, finance, and legal sectors [27,28,34]. Consequently, researchers are exploring various architectural and adaptation strategies to imbue LLMs with domain expertise, thereby enhancing both their performance and the explainability of their outputs.

One primary approach involves **specialized prompt engineering and contextual guidance**. This method tailors the input to the LLM to elicit more accurate and domain-relevant responses. For instance, in medical image classification, prompts can be meticulously designed for ChatGPT to "automatically generate detailed text descriptions of disease symptoms and visual features," which then assists visual-language models like CLIP in achieving "more accurate and explainable diagnoses" [30]. This mitigates potential inaccuracies of general LLMs on medical topics by guiding them to output "high-quality text descriptions of visually recognizable symptoms for each disease category" [30]. Similarly, in ecological and evolutionary coding tasks, specifying the "programming language, any specific packages you want to use" in prompts can significantly improve the quality of generated code, particularly for niche methods where generic LLMs often produce "nonsensical results" [28]. The ChatGPT ADA model implicitly leverages domain semantics, for example, by applying zero-imputation for genetic variants in hereditary hearing loss datasets, demonstrating an intrinsic ability to adapt its machine learning approach based on inherent dataset characteristics, thereby yielding more contextually relevant and explainable models for domain experts [19].

A particularly effective and widely adopted strategy for grounding LLMs in domain knowledge and enhancing explainability is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** [8]. RAG integrates external knowledge bases by first retrieving relevant information and then incorporating this knowledge into the LLM's prompt. This mechanism serves as an "inference-stage explanation technique" by providing transparent, evidence-based reasoning, which is crucial for verifiable domain-specific applications [8]. For example, DocOA, a specialized LLM for osteoarthritis management, integrates RAG with instructional prompts to guide a base `GPT-4-1106-preview` model [20]. This allows DocOA to provide "evidence-based medical insights" and "personalized management programs" by identifying the clinical evidence supporting its answers, thus inherently enhancing transparency and explainability within the medical context [20]. In academic peer review, a RAG framework enables LLMs to access "relevant PDFs" and "specific context and related work" to ensure knowledge of the "most recent scientific literature," tailoring the LLM for persona-specific roles like Guardian, Synthesizer, and Innovator [9]. Furthermore, He et al. (2022) introduced "Rethinking with Retrieval," an LLM post-processing method that refines reasoning paths generated by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts using external knowledge, directly aiming to enhance explanation faithfulness and overall performance in complex reasoning tasks [24].

Beyond RAG, **Knowledge Graph (KG) integration** offers another method for injecting structured domain knowledge, thereby addressing issues such as hallucination and improving explainability [24]. Pan et al. (2023) proposed a framework for KG-augmented LLMs, LLM-augmented KGs, and synergistic LLMs with KGs to enhance performance and explainability across diverse applications by providing explicit, structured domain context [24]. While RAG typically retrieves unstructured or semi-structured textual information, KG integration provides a more structured and semantic representation of domain knowledge, which can be particularly beneficial for tasks requiring logical inference or relational understanding.

In terms of **specialized architectures and fine-tuning**, bespoke LLMs are emerging in domains requiring deep expertise. In biomedicine, models like MoLFormer, Nucleotide Transformer, and the ESM family have been developed to handle molecular data, biological sequences, and protein language respectively [34]. BioGPT, trained on extensive biomedical literature, demonstrates exceptional performance in biomedical NLP tasks, although its specific contributions to *explainability* are not explicitly detailed in the digest [34]. A notable example demonstrating both enhanced performance and explainability is the application of Aug-imodels in a "natural-language fMRI study," where they predict brain voxel responses. Aug-Linear, an Aug-imodel, outperformed a black-box BERT baseline in this task, generating "interesting interpretations from scientific data" by identifying ngrams that activate specific brain regions, thus providing more transparent insights into semantic concept representation in the brain [16]. The SoS-ML framework further illustrates an advanced architectural approach to domain-specific explainability. For hypertension management, it integrates multiple specialized ML models trained on diverse, domain-specific datasets (e.g., lifestyle, gene expression, Electronic Medical Records), some even tailored to specific demographics (e.g., female-only data) to detect biases [17]. This modular, context-aware design allows for detailed, evidence-based insights, medication recommendations, and personalized lifestyle suggestions with clear reasoning [17]. In the realm of LLM security, NeuroBreak is specifically tailored to analyze jailbreak attacks and safety mechanisms, utilizing attack-enhanced datasets, probing classifiers for harmful semantics, and identifying "safety neurons" to develop targeted safety fine-tuning strategies [18].

A critical aspect of domain-specific explainability is the **tailoring of explanation design and modalities** to suit the particular context and user needs. As emphasized by various works, appropriate human understanding is sought by different stakeholders with varied goals and knowledge levels [2,31]. This necessitates that explanation design "must reflect the domain-specific constraints" and impose unique requirements on fidelity, truthfulness, plausibility, and contrastivity [15]. The TAXAL framework demonstrates this across diverse domains: explanations simplify legal jargon in legal document review, provide pedagogical scaffolding in intelligent tutoring systems, offer simple justifications for eligibility in public service chatbots, and translate model evaluations into clinician-friendly rationales in mental health screening [15]. Similarly, XAI frameworks in healthcare, finance, automotive, manufacturing, legal, education, retail, and cybersecurity all require explanations to comply with specific regulations, address safety concerns, or align with operational processes [31]. The SAX4BPM framework, for instance, focuses on "business process explanation" by eliciting "knowledge ingredients" and a "causal process execution view" specific to process contexts to "guard-rail" LLM performance in generating relevant explanations [4]. Moreover, the concept of "Thought Anchors" suggests a future direction where LLMs could be tailored to identify critical reasoning steps prevalent in specific fields like legal or scientific reasoning, thereby enhancing domain-specific explainability [3].

In summary, the consensus is clear: tailoring LLMs for domain-specific explainability is not merely advantageous but imperative for reliable deployment in specialized fields. While general LLMs struggle with niche knowledge and context, strategies like meticulous prompt engineering [28,30], RAG for verifiable knowledge grounding [8,9,20], and KG integration for structured knowledge [24] are widely adopted. Furthermore, domain-specific architectures or multi-model systems like Aug-imodels [16] and SoS-ML [17], along with highly specialized models like NeuroBreak [18], demonstrate superior performance and interpretability within their respective contexts. The crucial contrast lies in the nature of knowledge integration: RAG and KG primarily augment existing LLMs with external data, whereas specialized architectures often involve domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning, potentially offering deeper intrinsic understanding but facing challenges in adaptability and computational demands [34]. Future developments are likely to explore hybrid approaches, combining the flexibility of prompt-based methods and RAG with the structured knowledge of KGs and the specialized capabilities of domain-specific architectures. This also includes research into developing a "unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis" by leveraging LLMs' cross-task transferability and decision-making explainability [35], and continued efforts to refine context comprehension and user-specific explanation tailoring to foster trust and understanding across diverse professional landscapes [2,31].
#### 5.7.2 Domain-Specific Benchmarking for Clinical and Expert Systems
The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical medicine, finance, and expert systems necessitates a paradigm shift from generalized evaluation metrics to specialized, domain-specific benchmarking frameworks. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of generic LLM solutions in replacing established "business models" and utility functions within these specialized fields, alongside the absence of comprehensive standardization for evaluating domain specialization strategies [34]. The criticality of these domains, particularly healthcare and finance, imposes strict regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, Fair Lending Act) demanding heightened explainability, trust, and transparency, which general benchmarks often fail to address adequately [24,31]. This gap underscores the urgent need for tailored evaluation that accounts for "different stakeholders with different goals" and "different contexts" [2].

Tailored benchmarks bridge the gap between general knowledge and domain-specific proficiency by incorporating metrics and evaluation strategies that are acutely relevant to the particular field. For instance, in NL2Code tasks, rule-based metrics such as "Syntax correctness," "Format check," and "Language check" are crucial, demonstrating the necessity of task-specific evaluation criteria [29]. Similarly, in security assessments, specialized metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) are applied to datasets like SALAD-Bench, evaluating specific jailbreak methods (e.g., AutoDan, TAP, HJB, GPTFuzzer, GCG) and tracking changes during fine-tuning through visualizations like Metric View radar charts [18]. The SoS-ML framework further illustrates this by using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to achieve 80% accuracy in diagnostic predictions, providing evidentiary information through reliance scores and confidence intervals for specific diagnostic features, showcasing an evaluation approach deeply tailored to medical relevance [17]. Moreover, a "novel benchmark framework" specifically designed for osteoarthritis management evaluates LLMs across four progressively complex levels: Guideline-item QA (GIQA), Management Options QA (MOQA), Treatment Strategy QA (TSQA), and Real-Case QA (RCQA), directly addressing the "absence of tailored benchmarks in specific domains" [20]. This framework employs objective measures like accuracy alongside extensive human evaluation, a critical distinction from general benchmarks [20].

The development of dedicated datasets and metric suites further refines domain-specific evaluation. **WHOOPS!** evaluates visual common sense reasoning and explanation generation using intentionally counter-commonsense images, where advanced models notably struggle compared to human performance [24]. **SCIENCEQA** supports multimodal science question answering with 21k questions, lectures, and explanations, demonstrating that explanation generation via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes improves reasoning in complex scientific domains [24]. For evaluating stepwise reasoning, **ROSCOE** offers a taxonomy of reasoning errors and assesses semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality of generated rationales, crucial for expert-level tasks [24]. Beyond these, the MATH dataset serves as a domain-specific benchmark for mathematical reasoning, testing LLMs on problems where model accuracy ranges from 25-75% to analyze reasoning paths and interpretability methods [3]. These diverse benchmarks underscore that evaluating LLM performance in specialized fields extends beyond mere output correctness to encompass the quality of reasoning, explainability, and adherence to domain-specific principles.

A critical aspect of domain-specific benchmarking is the integration of human experts into the evaluation process. In clinical settings, the evaluation of LLMs for automated machine learning in clinical research uses real-world datasets and compares LLM-crafted models against optimized models by seasoned data scientists, utilizing metrics like AUROC, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity, with statistical comparisons for significance. Critically, the SHAP analysis for feature importance generated by ChatGPT ADA is verified through human expert review [19]. Similarly, for osteoarthritis management, the benchmark incorporates "extensive human evaluation" by "experienced physicians" and "patients" to assess criteria such as inaccuracy, relevance, hallucinations, harm, bias, comprehension, retrieval, reasoning, intent fulfillment, and helpfulness, providing a multidimensional assessment of clinical utility [20]. In the domain of business process explanation, a "rigorous user study" evaluates the "perceived quality" of LLM-generated explanations based on human perception criteria like fidelity, interpretability, trust, and curiosity [4]. For security, human experts (AI security specialists) are involved in case studies to validate the effectiveness of systems in identifying vulnerabilities [18]. The TAXAL-based validation framework for explainable agentic LLMs explicitly calls for "stakeholder-centered metrics such as trust calibration, comprehension accuracy, and counterfactual plausibility," illustrating that explanations must be tailored for different users—e.g., physicians requiring rigorous clinical reasoning alignment, and patients needing understandable rationales and reassurance [15]. This highlights a common thread across these studies: the indispensable role of human experts in comprehensive, human-centered evaluation for domain-specific explainability and overall utility.

While progress has been made in developing specific benchmarks, there remains "no comprehensive standardization or summary of methodologies" for domain specialization strategies [34]. Future development trajectories must focus on creating robust, standardized frameworks that can accommodate the unique requirements of diverse domains. This includes identifying new "context-specific evaluation metrics" that assess adaptive capabilities of agents in dynamic real-world conditions, as suggested by the SoS-ML framework [17]. Moreover, there is a clear need for "domain-specific studies to test explanation modes under varying user and task constraints" [15], emphasizing the need for evaluation frameworks that not only measure performance but also rigorously assess the quality and utility of explanations for specific expert users. The continuous evolution of LLM capabilities necessitates a parallel evolution in evaluation methodologies, ensuring that these powerful models can be deployed responsibly and effectively in critical, specialized fields.
## 6. Evaluation of LLM Explainability
The comprehensive evaluation of Explainable Large Language Models (LLMs) is paramount for fostering trust, ensuring responsible deployment, and validating their utility in diverse applications [2,31]. This process extends beyond traditional performance metrics, delving into the intrinsic quality and practical effectiveness of the explanations themselves. Evaluating LLM explainability involves assessing both how well an explanation reflects the model's internal workings and how effectively it serves the needs and understanding of human users [15,30].



![Core Criteria for Evaluating LLM Explanations](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/H-m5W25AKDlC9SsVXgX3d_Core%20Criteria%20for%20Evaluating%20LLM%20Explanations.png)

A robust theoretical framework for evaluating LLM explanations typically centers on core criteria such as **plausibility, faithfulness, and stability**. **Plausibility**, often synonymous with comprehensibility and human rationality, gauges an explanation's alignment with human intuition and cognitive processes, emphasizing its understandability and usefulness to the end-user [6,10]. In contrast, **faithfulness** (or fidelity) critically assesses how accurately an explanation represents the LLM's actual internal logic and decision-making mechanisms, ensuring that the explanation genuinely reflects *why* a particular output was generated [17,30]. Lastly, **stability** and robustness measure the consistency of explanations under minor input perturbations or repeated inquiries, addressing the reproducibility and reliability concerns inherent in LLM behavior [10,32]. These foundational criteria, while distinct, are interconnected and often present trade-offs, requiring a balanced approach to evaluation [4].

The assessment of these criteria necessitates a diverse array of methodological approaches. This includes quantitative **metrics for LLM-generated content**, ranging from n-gram based (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) and semantic similarity metrics to specialized evaluations for code, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and even LLM-based evaluators themselves [29]. Beyond content, **rationality evaluation** specifically scrutinizes the logical coherence and human-likeness of LLM explanations, often through fine-grained analysis of grammar, semantics, and reasoning, supplemented by human expert reviews and user studies to gauge "Human Reasoning Agreement" (HRA) [15,30]. Concurrently, **fidelity evaluation** employs rigorous model-level principles (e.g., implementation invariance, completeness) and test-set metrics (e.g., Comprehensiveness, Sufficiency, Decision Flip) to quantitatively ascertain the true alignment between explanations and the underlying model's mechanics, particularly challenging for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations which can be systematically unfaithful [24,30].

Crucially, **user perception and human-centered evaluation** form an indispensable component, recognizing that the ultimate value of an explanation lies in its interpretability, utility, and ability to foster trust in human users [2,6]. This involves qualitative and quantitative user studies assessing perceived interpretability, cognitive load, user satisfaction, and the alignment of explanations with human mental models and domain expertise [4,32].

Despite these sophisticated evaluation methodologies, significant **challenges in evaluation** persist. These include the lack of standardized metrics and robust evaluation indicators, the absence of ground truth explanations for complex emergent LLM behaviors, and inherent limitations of both traditional human evaluation (cost, subjectivity) and LLM-based evaluation (factual inaccuracies, biases, reproducibility issues) [10,29,30]. Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a continued focus on developing comprehensive, transferable, and human-understandable evaluation frameworks that integrate diverse perspectives and measurement techniques [22,31]. This integrated approach is essential for advancing the field of Explainable LLMs and ensuring their trustworthy integration into society.
### 6.1 Criteria for Evaluating Explanations (Plausibility, Faithfulness, Stability)
The evaluation of explanations for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging aspect of Explainable AI (XAI), necessitating robust and standardized metrics [31]. 

**Explanation Evaluation Criteria for LLMs**

| Criterion        | Description                                                              | How it's Assessed (Examples)                                  | Challenges for LLMs                                         |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plausibility** | Aligns with human understanding/intuition; comprehensible and useful.    | Human evaluation, expert review, user studies, cognitive load | LLMs prioritize plausibility over accuracy; "exoplanations" |
| **Faithfulness** | Accurately reflects model's internal logic/decision process.             | Quantitative metrics (COMP, SUFF, DF), causal validation, expert review | Lack of ground truth; unfaithful CoT; internal opacity      |
| **Stability**    | Explanations remain consistent under minor input variations/repetitions. | Consistency across runs, robustness against perturbations     | Non-reproducible responses; inherent randomness             |
| **Robustness**   | Maintain explanation quality despite adversarial attacks/changes.        | Attack Success Rate (ASR) for safety-critical systems         | Evolving attack vectors, model sensitivity                 |

Commonly recognized evaluation criteria for model explanations include plausibility, faithfulness, stability, and robustness [10]. These dimensions are crucial for assessing the utility, accuracy, and reliability of generated explanations, especially given the inherent complexity of LLMs [2,31].

**Plausibility** (also referred to as human rationality or comprehensibility) pertains to how well an explanation aligns with human understanding and intuition, making it appear reasonable or convincing to a human user [10,15,30]. This criterion emphasizes the user-centric aspect of XAI, focusing on whether explanations are understandable, useful, and aligned with human cognition [2,6,11,17]. For instance, the design of NeuroBreak prioritizes "clear visual encoding" to minimize cognitive load and enhance understanding of neuron functionality, thereby ensuring human plausibility [18]. Similarly, the "semantically reasonable" nature of Aug-Linear's coefficients, correlating with human-labeled sentiment scores (Spearman $\rho = 0.63$ for bigrams, $\rho = 0.71$ for trigrams), indicates high human-understandability [16]. Plausibility is often qualitatively assessed through human evaluations, expert reviews, or comparisons against human-annotated explanations using designed standards [10,15,21]. However, a key challenge is that LLMs "may favour grammatical correctness and plausibility over accuracy," potentially generating highly plausible yet unfaithful explanations [7,28]. This highlights the risk of overreliance on explanations that merely sound convincing but do not reflect the model's true internal workings [15].

In contrast, **Faithfulness** (also known as fidelity) refers to how accurately an explanation reflects the model's actual internal logic and decision-making process, including causal or influential factors [10,15,30]. It is critical for technical validation, auditing, and compliance [15]. This criterion measures if the explanation truly represents "why" the model made a particular prediction, rather than merely offering a post-hoc rationalization [17]. For example, in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, faithfulness is defined as the "factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context," verifying if claims can be deduced from the source [29]. While faithfulness is typically measured through quantitative metrics [10], a unified standard remains elusive due to the diversity of metrics focusing on different aspects of models or data [10]. A significant concern in LLM explainability is that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations "aren't always faithful representations of the model's actual reasoning" [8,12,22,24]. This systematic misrepresentation questions the reliability of CoT and similar natural language explanations [24]. Methods like Aug-Linear, which generate "exact" coefficients directly from the model's structure, are considered "considerably more faithful than post hoc methods, such as LIME and SHAP" [16,17]. Similarly, NeuroBreak's "Break the Neurons" function allows for "causal validation," directly testing the predicted effect of disabling neurons to assess faithfulness [18]. The "Guardian" persona in AI-augmented research review implicitly evaluates faithfulness by scrutinizing whether "experimental evidence truly support the conclusions" and identifying methodological flaws [9]. Furthermore, in clinical studies, SHAP outputs were found to be "plausibly quantified" and their accuracy confirmed by a seasoned data scientist, providing a measure of faithfulness [19]. The ability of systems like DocOA to "identify the clinical evidence upon which its answers are based" is a direct mechanism for ensuring faithfulness [20].

**Stability** (or consistency) and **Robustness** refer to whether explanations remain consistent under minor input variations or repeated runs [10,32]. This is particularly challenging for LLMs, where responses are "typically not reproducible" for regular users, leading to user disorientation [28]. However, it is important to distinguish between the reproducibility of the LLM's *generation process* and the reproducibility of the *results* produced by generated code or explanations, especially in contexts like scientific publishing [28]. Robustness against jailbreak attacks, measured by Attack Success Rate (ASR), is a critical aspect for systems like NeuroBreak [18]. SoS-ML enhances reliability and stability by refining error management and leveraging error diversity, quantifying confidence through "reliance scores" and "confidence intervals" (e.g., 81% reliance with 95% CI of 75%-87.5%) [17].

To illustrate the practical application of these criteria, consider a study evaluating LLMs as alternatives to human evaluators [21]. Here, **plausibility** was qualitatively assessed by human teachers reviewing the LLM-generated explanations for scores, finding them generally reasonable, albeit with subjective differences in interpretation [21]. **Faithfulness** was quantified by measuring the consistency of LLM ratings with human expert preferences, using metrics such as average Likert scores and Kendall's $$\tau$$ correlation coefficient between LLM and human ratings [21]. For **stability/consistency**, the study investigated the robustness of LLM ratings across different sampling parameters (e.g., temperature) and prompts, observing that relative rankings remained robust despite minor absolute score variations [21]. Similarly, reproducibility analysis for ChatGPT ADA confirmed stable behavior and consistent responses when prompted identically across different chat sessions [19].

Beyond these core criteria, other dimensions for evaluating explanation quality include truthfulness (factual correctness and absence of hallucinations) [15], contrastivity (highlighting distinctions from alternatives) [15], accuracy, completeness, user satisfaction [32], fluency, coherence, relevance, factual consistency, and fairness [29]. The TAXAL framework, for example, maps faithfulness to the causal axis, plausibility to the cognitive axis, and truthfulness to the functional axis, introducing novel metrics like Human Reasoning Agreement (HRA), robustness, and consistency calibrated for LLM-based XAI [15]. Despite these advancements, a significant barrier remains the "non-availability of standard metrics for evaluating quality in terms of explanation," with the definition of a "good" explanation being "largely subjective" [31]. There is a clear call for "human-understandable evaluation indicators" and further research to establish robust evaluation frameworks for prompting-based LLM explanations [10,22], especially as a trade-off between perceived fidelity and interpretability often exists [4].
### 6.2 Metrics for LLM-Generated Content
Evaluating the quality of content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their underlying behavior and for guiding the development of more effective explainability methods [15,29,31]. The landscape of evaluation metrics is diverse, encompassing both automated approaches for scalability and human-centric assessments for nuanced understanding [29]. Key qualities assessed include fluency, coherence, relevance, factual consistency, and fairness [29].

Evaluation metrics for LLM-generated content can be broadly categorized based on their reliance on human-annotated ground truth.

Reference-based metrics compare LLM outputs against one or more human-authored reference texts [29]. These are particularly useful when a clear "gold standard" is available.

*   **N-gram based metrics**: These metrics quantify the overlap of n-grams (sequences of N words) between the generated text and reference(s).
    *   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is primarily employed in machine translation but is also widely used for text generation, paraphrase, and summarization tasks [29]. It focuses on precision, measuring the fraction of n-grams in the candidate text that appear in the reference. The formula for precision $P$ is:
        $$P = {m \over w_t}$$
        where $m$ is the count of candidate words found in the reference, and $w_t$ is the total number of words in the candidate. BLEU typically considers unigrams, bigrams, or trigrams, and benefits from multiple reference translations for robustness, though it does not explicitly account for grammatical correctness or punctuation [29].
    *   **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**, in contrast to BLEU, emphasizes recall, making it highly suitable for summarization and machine translation where capturing essential information from the reference is paramount [29].
        *   **ROUGE-N** measures the overlap of n-grams between a reference (a) and a test (b) string. Its precision and recall are defined as:
            $$Precision = {\text{number of n-grams found in both a and b} \over \text{number of n-grams in b}}$$
            $$Recall = {\text{number of n-grams found in both a and b} \over \text{number of n-grams in a}}$$
        *   **ROUGE-L** focuses on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the reference (a) and test (b) strings:
            $$Precision = {LCS(a,b) \over \text{number of uni-grams in b}}$$
            $$Recall = {LCS(a,b) \over \text{number of uni-grams in a}}$$
        Both ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L often employ an F1-score to balance precision and recall:
        $$F1={2 \times\text{precision} \times \text{recall} \over \text{precision} + \text{recall}}$$ [29].
    *   **JS Divergence (JS2)** is another overlap-based metric utilized for assessing similarity through n-grams [29].

*   **Text Similarity metrics**: These metrics compute similarity by comparing the overlap of words or word sequences.
    *   The **Levenshtein Similarity Ratio** is derived from the Levenshtein Distance, which quantifies the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another [29]. The ratio is calculated as:
        $$Lev.ratio(a, b) = {(|a|+|b|)-Lev.dist(a,b) \over |a|+|b|}$$
        Extensions include "Partial Ratio," "Token-sort Ratio," and "Token-set Ratio," which adapt the comparison for different string structures and token arrangements [29].

*   **Semantic Similarity metrics**: Moving beyond surface-level textual overlap, these metrics leverage contextualized embeddings to measure the semantic equivalence of generated and reference texts [29]. Examples include BERTScore, MoverScore, and Sentence Mover Similarity (SMS), which represent strings as feature vectors (embeddings) and typically employ cosine similarity to assess their semantic proximity:
    $$ \text{cosine similarity} = {A \cdot B \over ||A|| ||B||}$$
    The score ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical) [29]. A critical limitation of these metrics is their documented "poor correlation with human evaluators, lack of interpretability, inherent bias, poor adaptability to a wider variety of tasks and inability to capture subtle nuances in language" [29].

When direct human ground truth is unavailable or insufficient, other evaluation paradigms become necessary [29].

*   **Reference-free Metrics (context-based)**: These metrics assess LLM output quality without relying on an explicit reference text, instead evaluating generated content based on its context or source document [29].
    *   **Quality-based metrics** are often used for summarization, detecting pertinent information. Examples include SUPERT (which uses BERT-based pseudo-references), BLANC (measuring differences in masked-token reconstruction accuracy), and ROUGE-C (a ROUGE modification using the source text as context) [29].
    *   **Entailment-based metrics** leverage Natural Language Inference (NLI) to determine if generated output entails, contradicts, or undermines a given premise, aiding in the detection of factual inconsistencies. SummaC, FactCC, and DAE (Dependency Arc Entailment) are notable examples, typically framing evaluation as a classification task (e.g., "consistent" or "inconsistent") [29].
    *   **Factuality, QA, and QG-based metrics** evaluate the presence of incorrect information. SRLScore (Semantic Role Labeling), QAFactEval, QuestEval (QA-based), and QG-based metrics assess factual consistency and relevance [29]. A significant drawback of reference-free metrics is their potential "bias towards their underlying models’ outputs and bias against higher-quality text" [29].

*   **LLM-based Evaluators**: This paradigm uses LLMs themselves to act as evaluators, offering potential benefits in "scalability and explainability" [29].
    *   **Prompt-based evaluators** involve prompting an LLM to judge text based on various criteria, such as fluency and coherence (text alone), consistency and relevancy (generated text, original text, and context), or quality and similarity (generated text vs. ground truth) [29]. Frameworks like Reason-then-Score (RTS), Multiple Choice Question Scoring (MCQ), Head-to-head scoring (H2H), G-Eval, and GEMBA for translation quality are examples where LLMs provide scores and optional explanations [29]. However, LLM-based evaluators are susceptible to "positional bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, limited mathematical and reasoning capabilities" [29]. Strategies like Multiple Evidence Calibration (MEC), Balanced Position Calibration (BPC), and Human In The Loop Calibration are employed to mitigate these biases [29].
    *   **LLM embedding-based metrics** utilize embedding models, such as GPT3’s text-embedding-ada-002, to calculate semantic similarity, similar to other semantic similarity metrics but using LLM-generated embeddings [29].

*   **Metrics for LLM-generated Code**: Evaluating code generated by LLMs involves both objective and qualitative assessments [28,29].
    *   **Functional Correctness** assesses whether the generated code produces the desired output for given inputs using test cases [29]. However, this is limited by the cost of setting up execution environments, difficulty in defining comprehensive test cases, and its inability to account for code readability, maintainability, or efficiency [29]. Human evaluators often qualitatively assess aspects like "novel, usable and understandable," "quality, usability, accessibility and functionality" [28].
    *   **Rule-based Metrics** define custom evaluation rules for domain-specific applications, including syntax correctness (e.g., semicolons, variable names), format checks (e.g., indentation, line breaks), language checks (e.g., grammar, word choice), and keyword presence [29].
    *   **Automatic Test Generation** involves LLMs creating diverse test cases, which are then solved by the LLM under evaluation, with another LLM-based system measuring performance against baselines [29]. Qualitative assessment by human users is emphasized to check for "variable quality," "mistakes," "approximations," and issues with "mathematics, logic, non-reproducibility" [28].

*   **Metrics for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern**: For RAG systems, evaluation extends to both the generated answer and the retrieved context [29].
    *   **Generation-related metrics** include **Faithfulness**, which measures the factual consistency of the generated answer with the given context (penalizing claims not deducible from the context, scaled to 0-1), and **Answer Relevancy**, which assesses how directly the response addresses the question and context, without considering factuality [29].
    *   **Retrieval-related metrics** comprise **Context Relevancy**, evaluating the relevance of retrieved contexts to the question (penalizing redundant information), and **Context Recall**, measuring the recall of the retrieved context using an annotated answer as ground truth [29].

Beyond general content, specific metrics are employed for evaluating LLM-generated assessments and explanations, which are critical for explainable AI [1,24,32].

*   **Likert Scale Scores** are a primary metric in user studies, allowing human evaluators to rate various dimensions of text quality (e.g., Grammaticality, Cohesiveness, Likability, Relevance for story generation; Fluency and Meaning Preservation for adversarial attacks) typically on a 1-5 scale [21]. These are often complemented by **Mean and Standard Deviation** to summarize score distributions.
*   **Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)**, often quantified using **Krippendorff's $\alpha$**, assesses the consistency between multiple evaluators (human or LLM) in their ratings [21]. The percentage of cases where evaluators provide exact same scores is also used.
*   **Kendall's $\tau$ Correlation Coefficient** measures the agreement in rankings between LLMs and human experts, indicating whether an LLM assigns higher scores consistently with human judgment, focusing on relative ordering rather than exact score agreement [21].
*   **Statistical Significance** tests, such as Welch's t-test, are used to determine if observed differences in average scores (e.g., between human-written and GPT-2 generated stories) are statistically significant [21].

For evaluating the quality of explanations specifically:
*   **ROSCOE** (Golovneva et al., 2022) provides metrics for assessing language models' stepwise reasoning when gold references are unavailable, evaluating model-generated rationales based on their semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality [24].
*   **WHOOPS!** (Bitton-Guetta et al., 2023) offers a benchmark for visual common sense reasoning and explanation generation, where models explain anomalies in images, with performance acting as a metric for explanation quality in complex visual scenarios [24].
*   User studies frequently employ **designated scales** for evaluating the perceived quality of LLM-generated explanations, gathering human judgment on interpretability and utility [4].

Beyond generic content, evaluation also extends to specific behaviors and domain-specific applications:
*   **Objective evaluation in specialized domains**, such as the medical field, might involve measuring **Accuracy** against benchmark subsets. For instance, in the osteoarthritis domain, the DocOA model achieved significantly higher accuracy across GIQA, MOQA, TSQA, and RCQA benchmarks (e.g., 0.92 on GIQA) compared to GPT-3.5 (0.26) and GPT-4 (0.38), indicating superior domain-specific knowledge and reasoning [20].
*   **Human evaluation by domain experts** (e.g., physicians) for models like DocOA provides crucial insights into issues such as inaccurate content (DocOA 19.3% vs. GPT-3.5 57%, GPT-4 50%), likelihood of harm (DocOA 8.3% vs. GPT-3.5 20%), and possibility of bias (DocOA 2.8% vs. GPT-3.5 13.3%) [20]. Patient evaluations further assess user intent fulfillment and helpfulness, with DocOA showing higher success rates (71.3% vs. GPT-4 39.8%) [20].
*   Metrics for LLM internal mechanisms include **KL Divergence** to quantify the impact of a sentence on final answer distribution or attention masking on token logits, where a higher divergence indicates greater influence [3]. **Attention Kurtosis** identifies "Receiver Heads" by measuring the peakedness of attention distribution towards key sentences [3]. **Pearson Correlation ($\rho$)** assesses the consistency between different attribution methods, for example, between receiver head attention and resampling importance (e.g., $\rho=.22$) [3].
*   For assessing model safety and security, **Harmfulness Assessment** using classifiers (e.g., based on InternLM2-7b-chat for SALAD-Bench) and **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** quantify jailbreak vulnerability, measuring the rate of harmful content generation [18].
*   Evaluation of complex systems that incorporate LLMs, such as the Pie Chart Interpreter, might include component-level metrics like **L1-Norm percentage** for image processing (84.35%), **accuracy** (99.54%) and **AUROC** (99.95%) for numerical relationship modules, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for Q-Learning agents (e.g., 0.1000 for three slices, 7.99 for ten slices) [17].
*   When LLMs are used to generate ML models, standard machine learning metrics apply, such as **AUROC, Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and Specificity** [19].

Implementations for these metrics and evaluation frameworks include Azure Machine Learning prompt flow (with 9 built-in methods), OpenAI Evals (a framework and registry of benchmarks), and RAGAS (an evaluation framework for RAG pipelines) [29]. The evolution of evaluation practices signals a move towards more structured, comprehensive, and context-aware assessment, transforming qualitative judgments into measurable data points for enhanced research and development [9].
### 6.3 Rationality Evaluation
Evaluating the rationality of Large Language Model (LLM) explanations is crucial for ensuring their trustworthiness and utility, especially when explanations are considered contextual social constructs that must align with human reasoning processes [17,31]. This evaluation prioritizes human-centric aspects, assessing how well LLM-generated rationales correspond to human expectations, logic, and domain knowledge [15,30]. The assessment spans both quantitative metrics and qualitative human judgment to provide a holistic understanding of an explanation's soundness.

For local explanations, typically within the traditional fine-tuning paradigm, rationality is often quantified at the input text or token level [30]. Here, evaluation dimensions encompass **grammar, semantics, knowledge, reasoning, and computation**, describing the congruence between masked inputs and human-annotated rationales [30]. Datasets used for such assessments necessitate human-annotated rationales that are both *sufficient* (enabling correct predictions) and *compact* (minimal removal impacts prediction) [30]. Common metrics for comparing token-level rationales include **Intersection-Over-Union (IOU), precision, and recall** [30]. For overall rationality, the **F1 score** is employed in discrete cases, while the **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)** is used for continuous or soft token selections [30]. Beyond these specific token-level metrics, `ROSCOE` (Golovneva et al., 2022) offers a broader suite of metrics to evaluate the stepwise reasoning of LLMs, assessing criteria such as **logicality**, informativeness, and factuality of generated rationales [24]. The `SCIENCEQA` dataset further aids in training LLMs to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations to improve reasoning abilities, offering insights into multi-step reasoning capabilities [24]. Similarly, for LLM-generated content like code, rule-based metrics such as "Language check" (understandability, consistency), "Syntax correctness," and "Format check" implicitly contribute to assessing logical structure and adherence to established rules, which are facets of rationality [29]. The `DocOA` framework, for instance, evaluates "Correct Comprehension" and "Medical Reasoning" by physicians, reporting high scores (e.g., DocOA at 91% for comprehension vs. GPT-4 at 86%, GPT-3.5 at 82.5%), which directly gauge the LLM's understanding and logical processing of information in a specialized domain [20].

In the prompting paradigm, particularly with CoT explanations, rationality evaluation shifts to whether explanations meet human expectations and possess **counterfactual simulation capability** [30]. This involves two metrics: **Simulation Generality**, measuring the diversity of counterfactuals the explanation helps simulate, and **Simulation Precision**, which is the proportion of simulated counterfactuals where human guesses align with the model's output [30]. However, a notable challenge is that LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 often exhibit low simulation precision, potentially misleading humans into forming incorrect mental models, suggesting that optimizing solely for human preferences may not guarantee counterfactual simulatability [30]. This underscores the difference between perceived rationality and actual predictive utility.

Qualitative methods and human expert reviews are indispensable for evaluating the "reasonableness" and alignment of LLM-generated explanations with human logic and cognitive processes [21,25]. The concept of **Human Reasoning Agreement (HRA)** measures how closely an explanation matches human rationales, capturing intuitive alignment and focusing on human understandability [15]. User studies frequently assess "perceived interpretability," "comprehensibility," "cognitive load," and "user experience," which implicitly gauge the rationality of explanations from a human perspective in real-world contexts, such as business processes [4,32]. For example, human evaluators, including machine learning Ph.D. students, assessed the semantic match of LLM-generated ngram expansions for Aug-imodels, consistently rating them above 4 on a 1-5 scale, indicating high perceived rationality and relevance [16]. Furthermore, the ability of LLMs to provide rational explanations for their judgments, such as ChatGPT citing specific sentences as evidence for its scores, has been validated by human teachers, who largely agreed with the rationality of these justifications even when disagreeing with the rating [21].

Domain-specific expert evaluations also play a critical role. In scientific peer review, an "AI Guardian" persona actively seeks out methodological flaws and logical inconsistencies, contributing directly to the rationality assessment of a submission, which is then synthesized by a human editor for an evidence-based decision [9]. Similarly, in clinical research, ChatGPT ADA's internal reasoning for data pre-processing decisions, such as zero-imputation in genetic studies, was qualitatively assessed as rational and aligned with pertinent literature, demonstrating decision-making rooted in domain context [19]. Human-centered narratives, such as in medical risk assessment, implicitly address rationality by providing clear, factor-weighted explanations that enable users to assess their logical soundness [11]. The SoS-ML framework emphasizes that human rationality prefers **causal explanations** over mere statistical probabilities and seeks explanations that support the "best inference," aiming for "Inference Accuracy" by providing transparent, traceable evidence of "why" a decision was made [17].

Despite these advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in ensuring consistent rationality. Deficiencies such as "causal hallucination" have been observed even with CoT prompting in causal reasoning tasks [24]. Furthermore, LLMs are noted to "struggle with mathematics and logic," implying inherent limitations in their foundational rationality for certain tasks, particularly in coding where explicit logical consistency is paramount [28]. The analysis of "Thought Anchors" in LLM reasoning, such as plan generation and uncertainty management sentences, provides insights into how the model's reasoning trajectory can shift towards a more rational solution, highlighting the potential for strategic intervention to enhance rationality [3]. Future developments in rationality evaluation must therefore focus on bridging the gap between quantitatively measured alignment and qualitatively perceived logical soundness, especially in complex, domain-specific contexts where subjective interpretations of criteria are prevalent [31]. This requires a continued emphasis on human-in-the-loop evaluation, context-aware metrics, and the development of LLMs capable of generating intrinsically causal and logically coherent explanations rather than merely statistically probable ones.
### 6.4 Fidelity Evaluation
Fidelity, in the context of explainable AI for Large Language Models (LLMs), measures the extent to which an explanation faithfully represents the actual internal logic, reasoning process, and decision-making mechanisms of the LLM [15,30,31]. It is a critical metric because explanations that are merely plausible but unfaithful can lead to a "false trust" and potentially mislead users, particularly in high-stakes applications [17,31]. The inherent opacity of LLMs presents a significant challenge to achieving true fidelity, necessitating "new approaches to provide transparency" [2].

A primary challenge to fidelity stems from the potential for LLMs to generate explanations that "do not accurately reflect the mechanical process underlying the prediction" [7], or to "systematically misrepresent the true reasons behind model predictions" [24]. This is often exacerbated by phenomena like "hallucinations," where models express confidence in inaccurate or incorrect responses, prioritizing "grammatical correctness and plausibility over accuracy" [9,28]. Such deficiencies underscore the need for robust fidelity evaluations.

**Model-Level Principles for Fidelity**
To ensure explanations genuinely reflect internal model workings, several model-level principles have been proposed, primarily applicable to explanations derived from the traditional fine-tuning paradigm [30]:
1.  **Implementation Invariance**: This principle dictates that attribution scores should remain constant for functionally equivalent neural networks, irrespective of their architectural differences. It is also known as model sensitivity [30].
2.  **Input Invariance**: Attribution methods should reflect the predictive model's sensitivity to valid input changes. For instance, attribution scores ought to be invariant to constant shifts in input values [30].
3.  **Input Sensitivity**: Attribution scores for features that explain prediction differences must be non-zero, indicating that features influencing the prediction are indeed highlighted [30].
4.  **Completeness**: This principle combines aspects of sensitivity and implementation invariance, often utilizing path integrals from calculus, making it primarily applicable to differentiable attribution methods [30].
5.  **Polarity Consistency**: This aims to prevent high-level features from undesirably suppressing the final prediction, which could otherwise negatively impact the interpretability of explanations [30].
6.  **Prediction Consistency**: Instances that share the same explanation should ideally yield the same prediction from the model [30].
7.  **Sufficiency**: Data instances sharing the same attribution should possess the same relevant label, even if their explanations might differ in other aspects [30]. These principles, while crucial, often address specific facets of fidelity, indicating that a singular, integrated solution for comprehensive fidelity assurance remains an ongoing challenge [30].

**Test-Set Metrics for Fidelity Evaluation**
Beyond model-level principles, several model-agnostic test-set metrics quantitatively validate the relationship between model predictions and their rationales [30]:
1.  **Comprehensiveness (COMP)**: This metric measures the change in the probability of the original prediction class after removing the top-ranked important tokens. A higher score indicates greater influence of the identified rationale on the prediction, suggesting higher fidelity [30].
2.  **Sufficiency (SUFF)**: It assesses the extent to which parts of the extracted rationale alone are sufficient for the model to make its prediction [30].
3.  **Decision Flip (DF)**: This family of metrics evaluates the sensitivity of model decisions to token removal.
    *   **Fraction Of Tokens (DFFOT)**: Represents the average proportion of tokens that need to be removed to trigger a decision flip [30].
    *   **Most Informative Token (DFMIT)**: Measures the rate of decision flips caused by removing only the single most influential token [30]. Ideally, higher DFMIT and lower DFFOT indicate more precise identification of important tokens and consequently higher model faithfulness [30].
4.  **ERASER**: This framework evaluates how effectively models attribute feature importance by masking tokens ranked by importance and observing the resultant changes in output [30].
5.  **Shortcut Learning**: Fidelity can be quantified by evaluating the degree to which models correctly identify learned shortcuts. Metrics such as precision@k (for the top k tokens) and average rank are used to assess how well top-ranked features align with ground truth shortcuts [30].
6.  **Polarity Test**: This checks fidelity by ensuring that the model accurately reflects both the importance and the polarity of features [30].

An algorithmic example for fidelity evaluation involves comparing the original model's prediction with that of a "masked" input, where only important tokens (identified by an explanation function and an importance threshold) are retained. The `fidelity_score` is then calculated as the ratio of correct predictions on these masked inputs to the total predictions [32]. For instance, a hypothetical InterpretableLLM framework achieved an explanation accuracy (fidelity) of 89.2%, significantly outperforming LIME (76.5%) and SHAP (82.3%) in such a scenario, demonstrating the quantitative assessment of fidelity [32]. Intrinsically explainable models, such as Aug-imodels (e.g., Aug-Linear), are noted for their superior fidelity, as their coefficients are "exact" and "considerably more faithful than post hoc methods, such as LIME and SHAP," directly reflecting the model's actual decision process without information loss [16].

**Fidelity in the Prompting Paradigm: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
For explanations generated through prompting paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), fidelity involves assessing "to what extent the explanation reflects the actual reasons behind the model's prediction" [30]. However, experimental analysis frequently reveals that CoT explanations "can be systematically unfaithful" [30]. LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and Claude 1.0, have been shown to "fail to acknowledge the impact of biased features" introduced by reordering options in few-shot prompts, indicating that their generated explanations "do not faithfully represent the true decision-making process" [30]. Counterintuitively, smaller models have occasionally been observed to "produce more faithful explanations compared to larger, more capable models" [30]. Further research notes that CoT reasoning can "systematically misrepresent the true reasons" [24] and that generated reasoning processes may not always be "entirely correct or reasonable" [12,22]. This unreliability is echoed in findings that LLM explanations can be "<Deficiency>factually unreliable" [24]. The study on multi-hop question answering even found that newer LLMs (e.g., Vicuna-v1.5, LLaMA2-7B) often "refused to make predictions when provided with intentionally incorrect CoT," while older, larger LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-J) sometimes exhibited better CoT fidelity, highlighting an unresolved challenge in ensuring faithful explanations in complex LLM reasoning [8]. Approaches like decomposing problems into sub-problems and answering them separately have been proposed to enhance CoT fidelity [30].

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a mechanism to enhance factual consistency, a form of fidelity, by linking generated answers to their original sources [29]. For instance, in clinical applications, DocOA leverages RAG to "identify the source on which the generated answer was based," thereby allowing professionals to "evaluate the rationale and accuracy of its response" [20]. This improves "factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context" through a two-step process of statement creation and verification [29]. However, RAG's efficacy is "contingent upon factors such as the size and quality of the data, retrieval techniques used, and the underlying architecture of the LLM" [20]. A critical limitation is that the semantic similarity-based "query process" can be "uncertain because the most appropriate answer does not necessarily yield the highest similarity score," potentially leading to incomplete or flawed retrieval, thus compromising the fidelity of the explanations and potentially guiding the model to incorrect answers [20]. Despite these challenges, efforts are being made to improve faithfulness in CoT through retrieval mechanisms [24].

**Human-Centered and Expert Evaluation of Fidelity**
Fidelity can also be assessed through human and expert evaluations, especially when LLMs are used as evaluators. For example, in an LLM evaluation paper, the fidelity of LLM assessments was compared to human expert judgments [21,25]. LLMs like Text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT demonstrated "strong preferences for human-written stories" over machine-generated ones across various attributes (Grammaticality, Cohesiveness, Likability, Relevance), consistent with English teachers' expert opinions, indicating a good level of fidelity to expert preferences [21]. The Kendall's $\tau$ correlation coefficient was used to quantify the alignment between human and LLM ratings, with correlations ranging from weak to strong (0.12-0.43) and being statistically significant for all attributes. This showed that if human experts rated a story higher, the LLM tended to do the same [21]. Nevertheless, challenges to fidelity were observed; for instance, T0 showed poor internal consistency, Text-davinci-003 tended to give higher absolute scores than humans, and ChatGPT was stricter, suggesting that while LLMs can capture relative quality, their absolute scoring and internal mechanisms may not perfectly mirror human evaluators [21]. This highlights that "perceived fidelity" can be enhanced by "guard-railing" LLMs with appropriate inputs [4]. Moreover, the "adversarial nature" of LLM-based peer review systems, combined with human verification, provides a "built-in error-checking mechanism" to ensure the fidelity of LLM assessments [9]. The debate on whether "opening the black box" is a realistic goal for XAI suggests a balance between purely technical measures of fidelity and human-centered considerations for effective explainability [6].

**Advanced Fidelity Assessment and Future Directions**
Newer approaches to assessing fidelity involve deep internal analysis. For instance, NeuroBreak explores layer-wise semantic evolution, identifies safety neurons, and analyzes inter-neuron collaborations using gradients to "deeply explain the LLM's internal workings." Its interactive "Break the Neurons" function acts as a direct fidelity test, allowing users to disable neurons and observe causal impacts, verifying how accurately identified explanations reflect the model's actual internal behavior [18]. Similarly, research into "biological circuits" and mechanistic interpretability aims to uncover true internal mechanisms, providing higher fidelity explanations than plausible-sounding CoT outputs [12]. The identification of "Thought Anchors" through triangular validation (black-box resampling, white-box attention focusing, causal attention suppression) provides compelling evidence of fidelity, showing strong correlations between distinct attribution methods and significant accuracy drops (28% vs 37% random) upon ablating key internal components, thus validating their functional importance [3]. Operationalizing faithfulness, therefore, increasingly involves "Causal tracing, input perturbation, and counterfactual analysis to verify alignment with the model computation" [15]. While model scale can increase traceability, it does not always translate into better alignment with human expectations, indicating a potential "decoupling of performance from interpretability" [15]. The future trajectory emphasizes moving beyond merely plausible explanations to truly evidence-based ones, directly derived from the system's internal representations, to achieve "Evidence Accuracy" and intrinsically higher fidelity [17].
### 6.5 Challenges in Evaluation
Evaluating the explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a complex and multifaceted challenge that extends beyond conventional metrics of model accuracy or plausibility [15]. A pervasive issue across the field is the **insufficient development and standardization of evaluation indicators for LLM explainability** [10,22,31,32]. This deficiency is particularly acute for complex systems like conversational AI, where existing metrics often fail to capture the nuanced qualities of explanations [8,10,22]. Consequently, there is an urgent and recurrent call for the development of evaluation indicators that are more "human-understandable" and align better with how humans perceive and utilize explanations [6,8,22,24].

A fundamental impediment to robust evaluation is the **absence of ground truth explanations for complex, emergent LLM behaviors** [30]. Unlike traditional computational processes, the autoregressive nature of LLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning makes its decomposition challenging for conventional interpretability methods [3]. This inaccessibility of true internal workings means that there are often "no benchmark datasets to evaluate global explanations" [30], complicating the design of accurate explanation algorithms and hindering the assessment of their faithfulness and fidelity [30]. Researchers highlight a "critical mismatch between plausible explanations and the faithful behavior of the underlying models" [15,24]. LLMs' inherent tendency to hallucinate and prioritize grammatical correctness over factual accuracy means their self-generated narratives may not faithfully represent their internal decision-making processes [4,7,12,28]. This unfaithfulness risks misinterpreting plausible-sounding outputs as truthful insights, potentially leading to "significant harms" [7]. Furthermore, the efficacy of widely used explanation proxies, such as attention mechanisms, remains a subject of considerable debate due to this lack of well-established evaluation criteria [13,30].

The evaluation landscape is further complicated by dual sets of challenges. First, **inherent limitations of traditional human evaluation** persist, including its time-consuming, costly, and unscalable nature [9,29]. Human assessments are often subjective, prone to conflicting opinions, and suffer from quality variation and irreproducibility [9,30]. Second, **new challenges are introduced by LLM-based evaluation itself** [10,21]. These include:
1.  **Factual Inaccuracies and Hallucinations**: LLMs, as evaluators or explanation generators, can produce factually incorrect content, necessitating human oversight and verification [9,28].
2.  **Behavioral Biases**: LLMs trained for safety (e.g., ChatGPT) may exhibit preferences for positive responses or refuse to rate sensitive content, introducing specific biases into evaluations [21]. Other biases like positional, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases are also observed in LLM-based evaluators [29].
3.  **Reproducibility Issues**: Continuous model updates by LLM providers can hinder long-term reproducibility if older versions become inaccessible, and LLM responses can vary for the same prompt, especially with sensitivity to prompt phrasing [19,21,28].
4.  **Subjectivity and Interpretive Differences**: LLMs may lack genuine emotional understanding, rendering them unsuitable for tasks requiring subjective emotional assessment [21]. Their inability to process visual cues further limits their comprehensive evaluative capabilities compared to humans [21]. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are often inconsistent with the same explanation model; for instance, an explanation ranked highest by one metric might be the worst by another [30].
5.  **Domain-Specific Benchmarking Gaps**: The absence of tailored benchmarks in specific domains significantly impedes the evaluation of LLM clinical effectiveness, necessitating the development of novel, domain-specific frameworks [19,20].

Addressing these challenges necessitates a shift towards "user-informed outcomes-driven protocols" and stronger evaluation protocols that move beyond isolated plausibility metrics [15]. The evaluation for prompting-based model explanations, in particular, is highlighted as an area requiring substantial further research [10]. The current literature identifies "Benchmark and Metrics" for evaluating LLM explainability as critical areas needing further study [24]. This includes developing standardized evaluation measures, standardization frameworks, and metrics for assessing trust levels [31]. There is also a recognized need for new evaluation metrics for modular systems like SoS-ML, focusing on agent collaboration, context-specific performance, and modular error tracing [17], as well as addressing potential biases from human feedback during interaction [17]. Ultimately, achieving robust and trustworthy LLM explainability requires comprehensive, transferable evaluation methods that fully integrate the human element and accountability into the assessment process [6].
### 6.6 User Perception and Human-Centered Evaluation
The effective deployment and acceptance of Large Language Models (LLMs) critically depend on aligning their explanations with human perception and cognitive processes. A pervasive theme across current research is the indispensable role of human-centered evaluation in assessing the utility, trustworthiness, and comprehensibility of LLM explanations [2,6,24,29,31]. This perspective recognizes that explanations are fundamentally "contextual social constructs" that must function as narratives aligned with how humans understand and interact with information [17].

Human judgment remains the ultimate arbiter of quality and trustworthiness, especially for critical outputs, necessitating a "human in the loop to verify the output generated by the model" [29]. This is particularly true given that semantic similarity metrics often exhibit "poor correlation with human evaluators" [29]. Explanations must be presented in "human-understandable terms" to foster trust, allow users to grasp model functions, limitations, and potential defects [22,27,30], and accommodate diverse technical backgrounds [8]. Achieving this requires XAI for LLMs to support "human interaction, trust calibration, and decision assurance," simultaneously serving "cognitive, functional, and ethical purposes" [15].

Several rigorous user studies have been conducted to empirically quantify aspects of human perception. For instance, a notable study evaluated the "perceived quality" of LLM-generated explanations for business processes by measuring "perceived fidelity" and "perceived interpretability" using a "designated scale" [4]. This research uniquely identified "perception of trust and curiosity" as critical factors that moderate the improvement in explanation quality [4]. Similarly, in the medical domain, the DocOA model for osteoarthritis achieved significantly higher user intent fulfillment and helpfulness compared to general-purpose LLMs. Specifically, DocOA attained a 71.3% success rate in user intent fulfillment, substantially outperforming GPT-4 (39.8%) and GPT-3.5 (36.5%). Furthermore, 75.8% of DocOA's responses were deemed "at least somewhat helpful," contrasting with 47% for GPT-3.5 and 47.75% for GPT-4 [20]. These quantitative results underscore the tangible benefits of tailoring LLM explanations to specific user needs and contexts.

Human experts are frequently employed as a gold standard in evaluating LLM explanations. In a study assessing LLMs as an alternative to human evaluation, English teachers generally found ChatGPT's ratings and explanations for writing tasks reasonable, even when unaware of the AI source [21]. However, disagreements often surfaced regarding subjective attributes such as "Likability" and "Cohesiveness," highlighting the inherent variability in human interpretation. For example, a teacher might disagree with a grammar rating that included punctuation errors, considering punctuation distinct from grammar, thereby accentuating individual subjective criteria [21]. This demonstrates the irreplaceable value of human feedback for nuanced understanding, despite LLM capabilities. Likewise, in assessing LLM-augmented features, Ph.D. students in machine learning rated the semantic match of explanations with high average scores (consistently > 4 on a 1-5 scale), indicating positive expert perception of the derived interpretable components [16]. Expert interviews also confirmed the usability and effectiveness of tools like NeuroBreak, which was praised by AI security experts for its "minimal learning costs and cognitive load," and "clear understanding of neuron functionality" [18]. The verification of SHAP analysis outputs by human data scientists further reinforces the human-centered aspect in clinical research, where LLMs facilitate transparency for non-technical clinicians [19].

While practical user studies yield critical insights, theoretical frameworks provide comprehensive dimensions for human-centered evaluation. The InterpretableLLM framework, for instance, outlines "用户研究评估" (user study evaluation) methods encompassing Task Completion Assessment, Trust Assessment, Satisfaction Assessment, Cognitive Load Assessment, and User Experience Assessment [32]. Although the reported empirical results for this framework (e.g., hypothetical user satisfaction of 4.5/5 and comprehensibility score of 4.6/5) are illustrative rather than from actual experiments, they define aspirational targets for LLM explanation quality. Complementing this, the triadic framework for explainable agentic LLMs emphasizes "Plausibility" (intuitive convincingness), "Cognitive Dimension" (comprehensibility and alignment with human mental models), "Stakeholder-Specific Evaluation," and "Trust Calibration" [15]. It also introduces "Human Reasoning Agreement (HRA)" as a novel metric for intuitive alignment and advocates for "Participatory Feedback Loops" with diverse stakeholders [15]. The SoS-ML framework further grounds explanation design in "Human Cognitive Alignment," drawing on neuroscience and linguistic theories to generate explanations as accessible narratives, confirmed through user evaluations [17].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist. LLM-generated explanations have been noted to exhibit "low precision," potentially "misleading humans into forming incorrect mental models" [30]. This suggests that merely optimizing for perceived rationality or user preference may not suffice if explanations do not accurately reflect the model's true reasoning, highlighting that subjective human judgment in evaluation can be unreliable [30]. This underscores the importance of reconceptualizing explanations as "exoplanations," which are valuable for "promoting critical thinking rather than for understanding the model" itself [7].

Future development trajectories for human-centered evaluation emphasize "improving human interpretability" [30], developing "user-centric XAI design," and incorporating "participatory design" and "user feedback loops" to tailor explanations to user needs [31]. This also entails generating "user-friendly explanations" through LLMs themselves to reformat complex outputs into comprehensible textual descriptions [8] and the creation of "human-understandable evaluation indicators" [22]. The focus on "Human-Centered Narratives" aims to convert complex model outputs into "narratives that align with user cognition" to build "decision trust" [11], further strengthening the commitment to user perception in the evolution of explainable LLMs.
## 7. Applications and Impact of Explainable LLMs
The pervasive integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse sectors underscores the critical necessity of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to ensure their responsible development, deployment, and sustained utility. 

![Transformative Impacts of Explainable LLMs](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/nUu7zVG5C8twIilDLaWou_Transformative%20Impacts%20of%20Explainable%20LLMs.png)

This section provides a high-level overview of how XAI not only demystifies the complex internal workings of LLMs but also drives tangible improvements, fosters trust, and enables their safe and effective application across a spectrum of high-stakes domains. It explores the multifaceted impacts of explainability, ranging from enhancing model performance and addressing ethical concerns to facilitating robust human-AI collaboration and introducing novel interpretability paradigms.

A primary impact of XAI is its instrumental role in **debugging and improving LLMs** [30]. By offering insights into model behavior, XAI facilitates the diagnosis of issues such as biases, logical inconsistencies, hallucinations, and performance gaps, directly leading to strategies for iterative enhancement [2,30]. Techniques like mechanistic interpretability and attribution methods pinpoint specific weaknesses, allowing for targeted interventions such as explanation tuning, refinement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, and compression instructions to boost model efficacy and reliability [12,18,30]. Furthermore, LLMs themselves can serve as diagnostic tools, evaluating and debugging code or other NLP systems, albeit requiring critical human oversight due to potential "unrealistic explanations" or "variable quality" in their outputs [28,30].

Beyond internal model refinement, XAI is foundational for **enhancing trust and ensuring responsible AI** [14,17]. In an era of increasing AI adoption, transparency is paramount for cultivating user confidence, bridging the gap between LLM complexity and human comprehension [31]. Explainability addresses key ethical and regulatory imperatives—such as fairness, accountability, and compliance with standards like GDPR—by clarifying the rationale behind LLM decisions. It provides essential mechanisms for detecting and mitigating critical risks, including bias, hallucination, privacy breaches, and safety vulnerabilities, as seen in targeted interventions for jailbreak mechanisms or bias detection in sensitive applications [15,17,18]. However, the potential for "illusion of LLM self-explanation" necessitates rigorous scrutiny and reliance on exogenous explanations to truly foster trust [7].

The impact of explainable LLMs is particularly pronounced in **practical applications within high-stakes domains** like clinical and medical diagnostics, academic research and peer review, and code generation and software development [9,15,28,31]. In healthcare, XAI facilitates trust in diagnostic recommendations and treatment plans, ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance through methods like SHAP analysis in general LLMs or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in specialized medical LLMs like DocOA [19,20]. For academic peer review, explainability introduces novel paradigms, such as the "LLM Triumvirate" using distinct personas and RAG to provide structured, multi-faceted, and verifiable evaluations [9]. In software development, LLMs excel at explaining, debugging, and optimizing code, yet their own generated code often requires XAI for evaluating correctness and quality, underscoring the indispensable need for human oversight [28,29].

Furthermore, LLMs are increasingly utilized as **self-reflective tools** and **instruments for XAI**, transforming their role from mere subjects of explanation to active agents in generating, refining, and evaluating explanations. LLMs can function as sophisticated automated evaluators, aligning with human judgments in assessing content quality and even generating detailed textual explanations for their scores, thus offering scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency in evaluation processes [21,29]. As tools for XAI, LLMs leverage their natural language capabilities to generate human-interpretable explanations, adapt them for diverse audiences, and even offer self-explanations through Chain-of-Thought reasoning [11,30]. Techniques like RAG enhance source attribution, grounding LLM responses in verifiable external knowledge bases, while persona-based reasoning and structured output mechanisms enable LLMs to deliver contextually relevant and systematically organized insights, thereby fostering clarity and interpretability [9,20].

The field also witnesses advancements in **augmenting interpretable models with LLMs** and the development of **hybrid human-AI explainability systems**. Approaches like Augmented-interpretable models (Aug-imodels) demonstrate how LLMs can be strategically employed during the training phase to enhance the performance and intrinsic interpretability of simpler models, achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing transparency [16]. Complementing this, hybrid human-AI systems emphasize a collaborative model where LLMs handle analytical and explanation generation tasks, while human experts retain the critical oversight, ethical judgment, and final decision-making authority [9,15]. This human-centered approach, facilitated by shared language and adaptive feedback loops, ensures that AI capabilities augment human intelligence, building trust and accountability in complex scenarios [17].

In conclusion, the applications and impact of explainable LLMs are transformative, addressing the core challenges of opacity, trustworthiness, and ethical deployment inherent in advanced AI. From foundational debugging and improvement to empowering human-AI collaboration and ensuring responsible practices across high-stakes domains, XAI is proving indispensable. While challenges related to explanation fidelity and evaluation biases persist, ongoing research—focused on robust explanation generation, advanced hybrid systems, and refined contextualization through structured outputs and source attribution—is continually pushing the boundaries of what explainable LLMs can achieve [29,30]. This evolving landscape promises a future where LLMs are not only powerful but also transparent, reliable, and deeply integrated with human understanding and values.
### 7.1 Debugging and Improving LLMs
Explainability (XAI) serves as an indispensable bridge connecting the inherent complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the critical need for their robust debugging and continuous improvement [1,11,25,27,31]. Given the "looming risks" and "challenges" associated with LLM development, transparency facilitated by XAI is crucial for diagnosing issues, comprehending system failures, and ultimately enhancing performance and reliability [2]. This diagnostic capability is vital because LLMs often exhibit "variable quality," "mistakes," "approximations," or "logical inconsistencies" in their outputs, necessitating a deep understanding of these failures for iterative enhancement [28,34].

Explanations function as powerful diagnostic tools, enabling researchers and developers to pinpoint specific weaknesses, biases, or logical inconsistencies within LLMs. For instance, XAI allows for the identification of unexpected biases, risks, and performance gaps by elucidating model behavior [22,30]. Such diagnostic insights extend to internal model mechanisms. Mechanistic interpretability, for example, reveals how specific behaviors, including errors like hallucinations, stem from internal "circuits" within LLMs, offering concrete pathways for identifying logical flaws and incorrect reasoning [12]. NeuroBreak quantitatively diagnoses LLM safety vulnerabilities by identifying internal mechanisms responsible for failures, pinpointing "dedicated safety neurons" and "vulnerable neurons," which supports targeted hardening of security mechanisms [18]. Similarly, attribution methods, which quantify input-output influences, diagnose LLM behavior by assessing answer quality and detecting hallucinations [8]. Visualizing attention patterns or contextual errors can also reveal problematic associations, such as reliance on specific tokens instead of overall content, indicating potential bias rather than genuine comprehension [13,27,30]. The "model visualization" of coefficients in Aug-imodels further allows users to "audit the model with prior knowledge" and identify semantically meaningful contributions, thereby diagnosing issues and verifying reasoning [16]. Moreover, "Thought Anchors" provide crucial intervention points for debugging LLM reasoning, as high-level organizational sentences (e.g., Plan Generation, Uncertainty Management) disproportionately influence error correction and path redirection, such as correcting an erroneous mathematical problem-solving path [3].

These diagnostic insights directly translate into concrete strategies for model improvement. One prominent strategy is **explanation tuning**, where smaller LLMs are trained using detailed, step-by-step explanations generated by more capable models (e.g., GPT-4). This approach provides richer supervisory signals than traditional input-output pairs, leading to superior performance in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks [30]. Similarly, **refining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts** utilizes explanations to guide better reasoning, improving performance in arithmetic, symbolic, and common-sense tasks by explicitly providing intermediate steps [8,30]. Another method is **compression instructions**, where insights derived from explanations (e.g., through ablation analysis) are used to identify and remove non-essential content from task definitions. Studies have shown that up to 60% of task definition tokens can be removed, maintaining or even improving model performance for models like T5-XL [30]. The `AMPLIFY` framework exemplifies this by using post-hoc attribution scores to generate natural language rationales that act as "corrective signals" for LLMs, enhancing performance in complex reasoning and language understanding [24]. Specific applications for model improvement include editing factual knowledge, enhancing long-context reasoning by analyzing attention drift, reducing hallucinations through attention-based interventions, and mitigating social bias through interpretable gradient flows [15]. NeuroBreak's ability to pinpoint vulnerable neurons allows for highly efficient and effective targeted safety fine-tuning, significantly improving security while preserving model utility, outperforming LoRA and achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning with fewer parameter updates [18].

The identified problems with LLM outputs, such as "variable quality" in generated code, underscore the necessity of explainability for debugging and improvement [28]. LLMs are valuable for "debugging code" and "optimising code" themselves, particularly in explaining "arcane error messages" and suggesting efficiency improvements [28]. However, this requires critical human oversight, as LLMs may prioritize plausible results over accurate ones, leading to "variable quality" and "mistakes" [28]. **Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD)**, for example, utilizes LLMs to generate hypotheses about code errors and interact with debuggers, providing "clear explanations for debugging decisions" that empower developers [24]. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluation indirectly serves as a diagnostic tool for other NLP systems. The explanations provided by an LLM evaluator regarding its ratings can offer specific insights into the failures or weaknesses of the *evaluated* system, thereby guiding its improvement [25,29]. For example, an LLM evaluator can explicitly identify deficiencies like a "made-up function" in generated code, aiding in debugging the output generation process [29].

Broader system-level improvements also benefit from XAI. The SoS-ML framework incorporates error management and diagnostic capabilities through modular error localization, where specialized Data Agents localize errors to specific features, simplifying downstream management [17]. It also leverages error diversity and averaging to improve accuracy and proactively detects biases, allowing for human expert consultation to identify root causes and implement corrective actions [17]. The framework facilitates continuous refinement through real-time human feedback, adapting predictions and improving robustness [17]. Moreover, "guard-railing" LLM performance with specific input can constrain its behavior, addressing issues like "hallucination" and guiding it toward more reliable outputs, which is a form of active debugging [4]. Even iterative review processes, like the "adversarial nature of the three personas" in research review, act as built-in error-checking mechanisms against LLM "hallucinations," establishing a cycle for refining LLM feedback mechanisms [9]. While traditional system-level debugging focuses on efficiency (e.g., pipeline parallelism to "reduce bubbles" or communication optimization to reduce bottlenecks), explainability focuses on the intrinsic interpretability of the model's decisions [23].

Despite these advancements, a critical challenge remains: LLMs can produce "unrealistic explanations that are still consistent with predictions," potentially leading to prediction errors and an "illusion of reasoning" rather than genuine insight into mechanical failures [7,30]. Therefore, improving the accuracy of model predictions fundamentally requires LLMs to generate reliable explanations, a considerable ongoing challenge [30]. Future research must focus on ensuring that explanations accurately reflect the model's internal workings to truly unlock their potential for comprehensive debugging and robust improvement.
### 7.2 Enhancing Trust and Responsible AI
The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications, particularly in sensitive and high-stakes domains, has made Explainable AI (XAI) indispensable for cultivating user trust and ensuring responsible AI development and deployment [8,14,17]. XAI serves as a critical bridge between the inherent complexity of LLMs and human comprehension, thereby reducing skepticism and fostering broader acceptance [31]. This section meticulously analyzes how XAI demystifies LLM decisions, facilitates adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, and provides mechanisms for detecting and mitigating critical issues like bias, hallucination, privacy, and safety. Furthermore, it critically examines the role and limitations of LLMs as evaluators in responsible AI frameworks.

**Fostering User Trust through Demystification**
A central tenet across the literature is that transparency, facilitated by XAI, is paramount for building trust in LLMs [6,22,24,27,30]. In high-stakes environments such as medical decision-making, finance, and critical business process management, XAI clarifies the reasoning behind LLM predictions, allowing users to understand model functions, limitations, and potential defects [4,8,11,15,16,24]. The improvement in perceived explanation quality has been empirically shown to be moderated by the perception of trust, indicating that explainability directly contributes to user confidence, especially when guided input fosters "perceived fidelity" [4].

Specific XAI techniques enhance trust by offering deeper insights into model mechanics. For instance, identifying "Thought Anchors"—critical sentences or reasoning steps within an LLM's process—provides a transparent and interpretable view of how conclusions are reached [3]. This granular transparency not only helps users and developers assess reliability but also enables the identification of logical flaws or biases, leading to more robust and trustworthy AI systems [3]. Similarly, the ability of LLMs to verbalize their reasoning or generate verifiable code, as seen in clinical research applications, contributes significantly to transparency and allows for external validation [19]. The TAXAL framework, for example, emphasizes "Trust Calibration," where cognitively accessible rationales allow users to appropriately calibrate their trust in LLM outputs, especially crucial for external stakeholders like patients seeking informed consent [15]. However, a critical caveat highlighted is the potential for the "illusion of LLM self-explanation," where plausible but unfaithful outputs can be mistaken for genuine reasoning, leading to significant harms if not accompanied by appropriate guardrails and external responses [7]. This underscores the necessity for true exogenous explanations rather than mere generated text.

**Ensuring Responsible AI and Ethical Compliance**
Explainability is unequivocally a cornerstone for responsible AI, facilitating adherence to ethical guidelines and regulatory mandates [1,6,15,17,22,24,27,30]. It addresses key concerns such as fairness, accountability, and safety, which are critical for the societal integration of LLMs [10]. The transparency provided by XAI is vital for regulatory compliance, including frameworks like GDPR and the EU AI Act, ensuring public credibility and legal accountability [15,24,31].

Responsible AI necessitates robust auditing mechanisms and oversight. XAI tools enable organizations to audit LLMs, ensuring alignment with human values and social norms, and mitigating potential harms arising from misinformation, bias, or social manipulation [30]. The TAXAL framework explicitly incorporates "Contestability," allowing users and auditors to challenge or refine outputs using counterfactuals and interactive rationales, and "Accountability," by providing causal fidelity and audit-ready traces for legal and regulatory contexts [15]. Furthermore, the System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML) framework distinguishes itself by integrating interpretability and explainability "by design" rather than as post-hoc additions, thereby embedding transparency inherently within the system's architecture [17]. This proactive approach ensures that AI systems are developed with transparency, ethical considerations, and human-centered alignment from inception. Beyond immediate model behavior, responsible AI also encompasses broader considerations such as the significant environmental impact and energy demands of LLM training and deployment, highlighting the need for improved energy efficiency and green computing for environmental responsibility [23,28].

**Mitigating Risks: Bias, Hallucination, Privacy, and Safety**
XAI plays a pivotal role in detecting and mitigating a spectrum of risks associated with LLMs, thereby bolstering their trustworthiness and responsible deployment.

*   **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Explainability tools are instrumental in revealing embedded biases, such as gender stereotypes or other problematic associations encoded within a model's learned representations or training data [28,30,32,33]. Probing classifiers can identify these problematic associations, and frameworks like SoS-ML demonstrate the ability to explicitly detect and mitigate biases within modular components, as exemplified by addressing gender bias in salary prediction scenarios [17].
*   **Hallucination**: Attribution methods are crucial for detecting and predicting hallucination risk, transforming XAI into a proactive tool for monitoring trust and safety [8,15]. Ensuring "factual consistency" through metrics like RAG's faithfulness also supports responsible AI by identifying and mitigating misinformation or unsupported claims [29].
*   **Privacy**: XAI addresses critical privacy concerns, including unauthorized data collection, use, and disclosure [19,24,31]. Implementing robust privacy protection mechanisms into model design and application is essential for building trust and ensuring responsible data handling [23].
*   **Safety**: XAI is paramount for enhancing LLM safety by preventing the generation of harmful content, such as misinformation, unethical outputs, or hate speech [10,18,30]. Understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs, including how jailbreak attacks operate, allows for targeted reinforcement of safety alignments and fosters a deeper comprehension of model behavior for ethical deployment [12,18]. The TAXAL framework also suggests that attribution-derived features can train secondary classifiers to predict safety violations, transforming XAI into a real-time safety monitoring tool [15]. Beyond content, strengthening security measures against malicious attacks like prompt injection is crucial for reliable protection and fostering trust in critical domains [23].

**Critical Analysis: Trustworthiness of LLM Evaluators**
The emerging paradigm of using LLMs as evaluators presents a dual challenge and opportunity for responsible AI [21]. On one hand, LLM evaluators can significantly contribute to safety by minimizing human exposure to potentially harmful content, such as violent, pornographic, hateful, or biased materials, during the evaluation process [21]. This protects human researchers and moderators from psychological distress and streamlines evaluation workflows. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluators can provide "explainability" alongside scalability, generating "explanations for the score assigned" to their outputs, thereby enhancing transparency in automated evaluation [29].

However, this approach introduces a critical ethical dilemma: LLMs themselves can generate biased or harmful responses, which could compromise the trustworthiness and impartiality of their evaluations [21]. The inherent biases acquired during LLM training, or even deliberate safety training leading to altered judgments, necessitate rigorous scrutiny [14]. Therefore, while LLM evaluators offer a viable "alternative" to human assessment, they are not a replacement and demand continuous ethical oversight and robust explainability to ensure unbiased and trustworthy assessments [21]. This highlights a crucial area where explainability must not only clarify the primary LLM's behavior but also critically assess the behaviors and limitations of LLMs operating as evaluators within the broader AI ecosystem.
### 7.3 Practical Applications in High-Stakes Domains
The increasing sophistication and pervasive integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse real-world applications underscore the critical importance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in high-stakes domains. These are contexts where the ramifications of errors, biases, or opaque decision-making can lead to severe consequences, ranging from ethical dilemmas and financial losses to compromised safety and legal liabilities `[2,11,17,24,26,27,32]`. The inherent opacity of complex black-box LLM models presents significant barriers to their widespread and trustworthy adoption, necessitating robust explainability solutions to bridge the gap between computational complexity and human understanding `[27,31]`.

Across various studies, a consistent set of high-stakes domains emerges where explainability is paramount. The framework proposed by `[15]` identifies critical applications in Law (legal document review), Education (intelligent tutoring systems), Healthcare (mental health screening, cardiac diagnosis), Public Services (eligibility chatbots), Human Resources (hiring platforms), and AI Safety/Cybersecurity (jailbreak detection). Complementing this, `[31]` highlights the necessity of XAI in Healthcare (diagnosis, treatment), Finance (risk assessment, fraud detection), Legal and Compliance (document review, predictive policing), Autonomous Systems (decision-making), Manufacturing and Supply Chain (predictive maintenance), Human Resources (recruitment), Natural Language Processing (sentiment analysis), and Marketing and Advertising (customer segmentation). Further domains emphasized in the literature include Academic Research and Peer Review `[9]`, Code Generation and Software Development `[28]`, Business Process Management `[4]`, and various scientific fields like Ecology and Evolution `[28]` and Biomedicine `[34]`. Common threads across these sectors include the need for XAI to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and compliance with regulatory standards, as seen in strict regulations like GDPR in Europe `[24]`.

XAI acts as a crucial enabler for accountability and transparency in these critical areas. For instance, in healthcare, XAI facilitates the interpretation of AI recommendations for disease diagnosis and treatment, building trust among medical professionals, as exemplified by applications like cancer diagnosis `[31]`. In finance, XAI clarifies credit scoring rationales, preventing claims of unfair judgments, and provides understandable explanations for flagged suspicious transactions, directly addressing fraud detection `[31]`. Beyond these, XAI provides justifications for legal decisions, elucidates autonomous system behaviors for safety, and ensures fair practices in human resources. The absence of explainability has led to notable real-world failures, such as racial bias in the COMPAS algorithm in criminal justice, biased image recognition leading to misidentification, fatal accidents involving Tesla Autopilot, incorrect recommendations from IBM Watson for Oncology, and gender bias in Apple's credit card algorithm `[17]`. These cases underscore that computational optimality alone is insufficient; social optimality, transparency, fairness, and accountability must be embedded through XAI from the design phase `[17]`.

This section serves as a foundational overview, introducing the expansive landscape of high-stakes domains and the overarching need for LLM explainability. The subsequent subsections will delve into specific applications within Clinical and Medical Diagnostics, Academic Research and Peer Review, and Code Generation and Software Development. Each child section will explore the unique challenges, tailored XAI methodologies, and specific examples pertinent to its domain, providing detailed analyses of how explainability fosters trust, enhances decision-making, and mitigates risks. This structured approach aims to synthesize the commonalities in the need for XAI while accentuating the nuanced differences in its application and required depth across diverse high-stakes contexts. Future development trajectories will undoubtedly involve strengthening the empirical validation of these explainable systems, refining context-aware and stakeholder-specific explanation generation, and establishing robust benchmarks for assessing both performance and transparency across these critical applications.
#### 7.3.1 Clinical and Medical Diagnostics
The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical and medical diagnostics is a high-stakes domain where explainability (XAI) is not merely beneficial but essential for fostering trust, ensuring patient safety, and complying with stringent regulatory standards [16,24,27,31]. The opacity of black-box models poses significant challenges in healthcare, necessitating transparent and ethical explanations for broader acceptance and practical deployment [24].

General-purpose LLMs, when adapted for clinical data analysis, demonstrate impressive capabilities, as exemplified by ChatGPT ADA. This system autonomously formulates and executes advanced machine learning (ML) techniques across diverse medical specialties, often matching or surpassing the performance of manually crafted ML methods [19]. For instance, in predicting metastatic disease, ChatGPT ADA's Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model achieved an AUROC of 0.949, slightly outperforming the original AdaBoost model's 0.942. Similarly, for esophageal cancer screening, its GBM model yielded an AUROC of 0.979 compared to LightGBM's 0.960. While its Random Forest (RF) classifier showed an AUROC of 0.773 for hereditary hearing loss diagnosis, exceeding the original Support Vector Machine (SVM) (0.751), it exhibited inferior accuracy and F1-score in that specific task. For cardiac amyloidosis prediction, its RF classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.954 against the original RF's 0.930 [19]. Crucially, the explainability of ChatGPT ADA's predictions is often enhanced through techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis, which identifies and quantifies the influence of key features such as sex, age, lab values, cytologic characteristics, gene variants, and medical history on diagnostic outcomes, thereby increasing transparency and understanding in critical decision-making processes [19]. Moreover, general LLMs, in conjunction with visual-language models like CLIP, have been leveraged for explainable zero-shot medical image classification. ChatGPT, for example, can generate detailed textual descriptions of disease symptoms and visual features, which then assist CLIP in providing more accurate and explainable diagnoses. Prompt engineering is employed to mitigate potential inaccuracies in ChatGPT's medical output, ensuring high-quality descriptions of visually recognizable symptoms [30].

However, general LLMs face inherent challenges in medical contexts due to the highly specialized language and the demand for in-depth, real-time, accurate domain knowledge [34]. This limitation underscores the benefits of tailored, explainable medical LLMs. A prime example is DocOA, a specialized LLM designed specifically for osteoarthritis (OA) management. DocOA addresses the complexities of OA, which involve diverse pharmacological treatments, lifestyle modifications, rehabilitation, and surgical interventions, alongside the need to integrate extensive evidence-based medical data [20]. DocOA distinguishes itself by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling it to explicitly identify "the clinical evidence upon which its answers are based." This mechanism directly supports transparency and mitigates risks in OA management by providing evidence-based knowledge and personalized treatment plans, evaluated using benchmarks that include "Real-Case QA" reflecting real-world clinical scenarios with anonymized patient data [20].

Another significant development is the SoS-ML framework, a sophisticated functional XAI (fXAI) system designed for clinical and medical diagnostics. When applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, SoS-ML achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, representing a 5-10% improvement over traditional models, and provided robust uncertainty measures such as reliance scores and confidence intervals (e.g., 81% reliance with 95% CI of 75–87.5% for specific groupings), offering a more reliable assessment than black-box models [17]. Furthermore, SoS-ML has been conceptualized for a hypertension management system, offering detailed insights, data pattern analysis, medication recommendations, personalized lifestyle suggestions with reasoning, and an alert system to minimize false alarms. Its modular and context-aware architecture integrates multiple specialized ML models (Data Agents) and subsystems trained on diverse medical data, including lifestyle, gene expression, and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, even incorporating gender-specific analysis to detect biases. This design is paramount for integrating extensive evidence-based medical information, ensuring transparency, and reducing risks in clinical decision-making [17]. Similarly, the InterpretableLLM framework, applied in a "智能诊断辅助系统," provides diagnostic explanations, visualizes AI decision processes, communicates uncertainty, and facilitates knowledge discovery, hypothetically leading to a 15% increase in diagnostic accuracy and a 30% reduction in diagnosis time, although these empirical results are illustrative rather than experimentally validated [32].

The nuanced requirements for explainability in medicine are further highlighted by the TAXAL framework, which emphasizes stakeholder-specific explanations in a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for cardiac conditions [15]. For clinicians, explanations must support rigorous medical reasoning, model critique, and auditability. This involves highlighting salient clinical markers (cognitive), presenting diagnostic reasoning paths akin to Chain-of-Thought prompts (functional), and enabling "what if" simulations through counterfactuals (causal). In contrast, patient-centered explanations prioritize comprehensibility and reassurance, offering plain-language rationales (cognitive), supporting shared decision-making (functional), and ensuring transparency and fairness without overwhelming technical details (causal) [15]. This differentiation in explanation delivery contrasts with systems like SoS-ML, which provides more generalized detailed insights and recommendations [17], and InterpretableLLM's visualization of decision processes [32]. The ability of LLMs to generate human-centered narratives, such as explaining an abnormal lung scan or providing factor-weighted hypertension risk assessments, further aids medical professionals in understanding AI predictions [11].

The evolution from general-purpose LLMs to domain-specific, explainable medical LLMs (like BioGPT for biomedical NLP [34], DocOA, and SoS-ML) represents a critical trajectory in the field. Future developments will likely focus on strengthening the empirical validation of these systems, expanding the application of modular and context-aware XAI frameworks across a broader spectrum of medical subdomains, and refining stakeholder-aware explanation generation. Continuous development of rigorous benchmarks, such as DocOA's Real-Case QA, will be indispensable for thoroughly evaluating both the clinical capabilities and the explainability of these advanced AI systems [20]. The ultimate goal remains the seamless integration of AI into clinical practice, where explainability serves as the bridge connecting complex AI insights with human trust and effective decision-making.
#### 7.3.2 Academic Research and Peer Review
The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to academic peer review emerges as a novel explainability solution, addressing long-standing challenges of transparency, consistency, and subjectivity in scholarly evaluation. One conceptual framework proposes a re-engineered peer review system leveraging an "LLM Triumvirate" comprising distinct personas: the "Guardian," "Synthesizer," and "Innovator" [9]. This model explicitly aims to transform the traditionally opaque and often subjective peer review process into one that offers structured, verifiable, and multi-faceted insights, thereby enhancing its overall explainability and trustworthiness [9].

Each LLM persona is assigned an adversarial role designed to provide a unique analytical perspective, contributing to a comprehensive and transparent evaluation. The "Guardian" persona is tasked with identifying methodological flaws and ensuring the rigor and soundness of the research presented. Concurrently, the "Synthesizer" contextualizes the submitted work within the broader academic landscape, assessing its coherence with existing literature and its contribution to the field. Finally, the "Innovator" focuses on evaluating the novelty and originality of the research, scrutinizing its potential to advance the discipline [9]. This structured approach, where distinct viewpoints are generated, directly addresses inherent subjectivity and potential biases prevalent in human peer review by presenting a "single, coherent dossier containing three distinct analytical viewpoints" [9]. The explicit articulation of these varied perspectives ensures that the rationale behind feedback is transparent and verifiable, offering a significantly more explainable review output.

Further enhancing the explainability of this LLM-augmented review process is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology [9]. RAG grounds the LLMs' critiques in current and relevant scholarly literature, ensuring that their analyses are not only insightful but also factually supported and up-to-date [9]. By referencing the most recent scientific literature, RAG mitigates concerns regarding LLM hallucination or reliance on outdated information, providing a robust evidentiary basis for the generated feedback. This grounding in verifiable external knowledge makes the LLM-generated reviews more credible and understandable to authors and editors alike, as the basis for evaluation can be traced back to established academic discourse.

Unlike general LLM explainability research, which might focus on diverse applications such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems providing token-level saliency for educational feedback [15], this specific framework targets the high-stakes domain of academic publishing. While other works explore the utility of LLMs in various contexts, they do not detail the specific challenges and proposed solutions for academic peer review, nor do they introduce the "Guardian," "Synthesizer," or "Innovator" personas, or the role of RAG in scholarly literature review [15,30]. The model's unique contribution lies in its systematic approach to deconstructing a paper's evaluation into several verifiable analytical streams, thereby fostering greater confidence and transparency in the review process and directly addressing the core failures of the current human-centric system [9]. This multi-faceted, persona-driven evaluation offers a promising trajectory for the future of academic research, moving towards a more objective and explicable peer review paradigm.
#### 7.3.3 Code Generation and Software Development
Large Language Models (LLMs) are profoundly transforming the landscape of code generation and software development, extending their utility beyond mere task execution to active knowledge dissemination. This section analyzes the dual role of LLMs in code-related explainability: first, as powerful tools *for* explaining and manipulating code, and second, as complex systems *that require* explanation when generating faulty or suboptimal code.

LLMs have emerged as versatile assistants in numerous coding tasks, primarily leveraging their capacity to process and generate human-like text from extensive training data, including vast repositories of code and natural language [28,34]. Their capabilities in this domain are multifaceted, encompassing the ability to "generate code," "explain code," "comment code," "translate code," "debug code," "optimise code," and assist with "unit tests" [28,34]. For instance, they can create functional code from natural language prompts, even for users without extensive programming backgrounds [28]. Beyond creation, LLMs can elucidate the purpose and function of existing code snippets, whether self-written or imported, thereby significantly contributing to developer understanding and learning [28]. They can also generate routine comments to enhance code reproducibility and clarity, and translate code between different programming languages or packages [28]. In debugging, LLMs prove invaluable by identifying errors and explaining "arcane error messages," as demonstrated by systems like Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD) [24,28]. AutoSD, for example, uses LLMs to generate hypotheses for code errors, interact with debuggers, and crucially, provides clear explanations for debugging decisions, enabling more efficient and accurate problem resolution [24]. This directly applies LLMs with explainability for practical software development tasks. Furthermore, LLMs can optimize code for efficiency and speed and assist in structuring standard unit tests [28]. The integration of LLMs as "code assistants" simplifies technical burdens, allowing non-experts to leverage advanced capabilities, such as automating machine learning model development (e.g., feature engineering, algorithm selection, data preprocessing) without direct coding expertise, as observed with ChatGPT ADA [19,33].

Despite these substantial benefits, LLMs as code generators present their own explainability challenges, particularly when producing faulty code. While LLMs like GPT-3 and T5 have shown impressive efficacy in program synthesis and code completion by leveraging contextual representations from extensive code samples and natural language data, outperforming earlier deep learning approaches on benchmarks like CodeXGLUE [34], the quality of LLM-generated code remains "variable" [28,29]. A key limitation is their propensity for issues with "mathematics, logic, non-reproducibility," and outright "mistakes," especially when encountering novel methods [28,29]. This inherent variability and potential for errors necessitate a robust framework for evaluating and understanding why certain code outputs are produced.

To address the need for explainability in LLM-generated code, several evaluation metrics have been proposed. Functional correctness is a primary assessment, verifying if the code yields desired outputs for given inputs through defined test cases [29]. However, this approach faces limitations, including the high cost of setting up execution environments, the difficulty in creating comprehensive test cases, and its inability to assess non-functional attributes like readability, maintainability, or efficiency [29]. Rule-based metrics offer complementary insights, checking for "syntax correctness" (e.g., compliance with programming language rules), "format checks" (e.g., indentation, line breaks), "language checks" (evaluating understandability and consistency with input), and "keyword presence" [29]. LLMs can also be leveraged for "automatic test generation," producing diverse test cases to evaluate the code-solving capabilities of other LLMs, measured against metrics like relevance and fluency [29].

Crucially, the "variable quality" and potential for errors in LLM-generated code underscore the importance of human oversight. The digests consistently highlight the necessity for human "interpreting LLM-generated code" and developing "critical thinking skills" to ensure understanding, correctness, and explainability [28]. This emphasizes that while LLMs can significantly accelerate software development, their outputs are not infallible and require human validation to bridge the gap between automated generation and reliable deployment. The principle of understanding internal reasoning, even if not explicitly detailed for code generation in some papers [12], is vital for debugging and improving the reliability of LLM-generated code. Future development trajectories must therefore focus on enhancing the intrinsic explainability of LLM code generation processes, not just their ability to explain existing code, to foster greater trust and widespread adoption in critical software development contexts.
### 7.4 LLMs as Self-Reflective Tools: The Case of Automated Evaluation
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a novel paradigm where these models transcend their traditional role as content generators to become sophisticated evaluators of other generated output, demonstrating a unique form of self-reflection within AI systems. This "LLM Evaluation" represents a disruptive application, enabling LLMs to not only perform complex tasks but also to critically assess the quality, coherence, and relevance of various forms of content, thereby addressing long-standing challenges associated with conventional human evaluation processes [21].

LLMs are categorized as effective "Explanation Generators/Evaluators" due to their high functional alignment, serving as automated plausibility evaluators capable of assessing explanations by comparing them against human-annotated rationales or benchmark datasets [15]. This capability facilitates workflows such as automated rationale annotation and plausibility scoring, and in low-resource settings, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to emulate human annotators for both training and evaluation of explanation models [15]. The methodology typically involves prompting LLMs to assess text based on predefined criteria, ranging from reference-free aspects like fluency and coherence to context-dependent factors such as consistency and relevancy, or reference-based evaluations comparing quality and similarity [29]. For instance, a structured evaluation process for an NL2Python application guides the LLM through syntax checking, comparison, static analysis, and quality assessment, culminating in a numerical score and an explanatory justification [29]. Beyond text quality assessment, LLMs contribute to specialized evaluations, such as classifying the harmfulness of outputs to quantify jailbreak vulnerability via Attack Success Rate (ASR) using classifiers like InternLM2-7b-chat [18]. Furthermore, this self-reflective capability extends to dynamic optimization within multi-agent systems, where a Q-Learning Agent, as seen in the SoS-ML framework's Pie Chart Interpreter, intelligently selects optimal agent combinations based on task complexity. This agent learns from comparisons against ground truth, updating its Q-table based on rewards (e.g., Mean Squared Error) to refine strategies, thereby providing an inherent context-aware mechanism for self-evaluation and performance improvement [17]. In academic peer review, LLMs have been proposed to generate "instantaneous LLM-generated reviews" offering initial comments and suggestions for papers, streamlining feedback and optimizing human effort while human experts retain final decision-making [9].

Empirical evidence substantiates the effectiveness of LLM evaluators, particularly in their alignment with human judgments and robustness. In a study involving two NLP tasks, LLMs (text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT) demonstrated significant alignment with human expert judgments. For open-ended story generation, these LLMs consistently preferred human-written stories over GPT-2 generated ones, mirroring expert English teachers' assessments. Kendall's $\tau$ correlations between text-davinci-003 and human teachers ranged from 0.12 (Grammaticality) to 0.43 (Relevance), all statistically significant [21]. In adversarial attack quality assessment, ChatGPT and human teachers concurred that adversarial samples were of lower quality, and ChatGPT correctly identified that BAE produced higher quality adversarial samples than Textfooler and PWWS, aligning with human consensus. The LLM's understanding was further highlighted by its consistent 5.00 score for meaning preservation when comparing identical benign samples [21]. Crucially, LLM evaluation results were found to be largely robust to minor variations in task instructions and answer sampling parameters, such as temperature, indicating their reliability [21].

The practical advantages of deploying LLMs as evaluators are substantial. They offer enhanced "scalability and explainability," providing not just scores but also optional explanations for their judgments [29]. Compared to human evaluation, LLM evaluation is more reproducible, owing to the explicit specification of the model, random seed, and generation hyperparameters [21]. Each sample is evaluated independently, mitigating human biases that can arise from sequential evaluations [21]. Furthermore, LLMs offer significant cost and speed efficiencies, completing evaluations (e.g., 200 stories for < $5 in hours) far more economically and rapidly than human evaluators (e.g., $140 over a week) [21]. An additional ethical advantage is the reduced necessity for human evaluators to process potentially violent, hateful, or otherwise undesirable content [21].

Despite these advantages, the application of LLMs as evaluators is not without limitations and ethical considerations. The quality of LLM-generated evaluations is heavily dependent on prompt engineering and frequently lacks ground-truth causality, which is critical for robust explainability [15]. Existing research, though still emerging and not systematically studied, has identified issues such as "positional bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, limited mathematical and reasoning capabilities, and difficulties in assigning precise numerical scores" [29]. Specific limitations include the potential for factual inaccuracies, rendering them unsuitable for knowledge-intensive tasks [21]. Behavioral biases stemming from safety training (e.g., ChatGPT's preference for positive responses or refusal to rate emotional attributes) can impact objectivity [21]. The frequent updates by model providers pose reproducibility challenges if older versions become unavailable [21]. Inconsistency in scoring tendencies among different LLMs (e.g., text-davinci-003 tending higher, ChatGPT being stricter) and subjective interpretations, even when explanations are generally reasonable, highlight the nuances of their judgment. LLMs also exhibit a lack of genuine emotional understanding, making them unreliable for tasks requiring emotional judgment, and are unable to process visual cues in instructions, limiting their capabilities compared to human evaluators [21]. Consequently, human verification remains necessary, especially for domain-specific tasks [29]. Mitigation strategies, such as Multiple Evidence Calibration (MEC), Balanced Position Calibration (BPC), and Human In The Loop Calibration, are proposed to address these biases and limitations [29]. This application, while leveraging LLMs' instruction-following and explanation-generating abilities to streamline evaluation, simultaneously creates new demands for explainability, requiring clear insights into the LLM evaluators' judgments and their underlying reasoning.
### 7.5 LLMs as Tools for XAI
The relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly reciprocal, extending beyond LLMs being mere subjects of explanation to becoming powerful instruments for generating, refining, and evaluating explanations themselves. This paradigm shift emphasizes the capacity of LLMs to act as "active agents in explanation processes" [15], facilitating the generation of "causally sound and yet human-interpretable explanations" [4]. This section explores specific strategies and applications where LLMs contribute significantly to the XAI ecosystem, transforming complex AI outputs into understandable insights for diverse audiences [8,31].

A primary application of LLMs in XAI is their capability to **generate natural language explanations** that bridge the gap between technical AI outputs and human comprehension. Within frameworks like SoS-ML, fine-tuned LLMs serve as Language Acquisition Devices (LADs), converting structured inference-evidence pairs and internal system information into comprehensive, context-aware "explanation logs" [17]. This process transforms raw data into narrative explanations, making AI reasoning accessible to end-users, developers, and other stakeholders, thereby significantly enhancing usability and reducing the manual effort typically required for interpretation [17]. Similarly, in the SAX4BPM framework, LLMs synthesize various inputs to generate human-interpretable, context-aware explanations for business processes, directly supporting the goal of delivering causally sound explanations [4]. This aligns with broader calls for LLMs to serve as tools for providing post-hoc explanations for predictions of other machine learning models, increasing the usability and efficiency of explanation algorithms [30]. Beyond translating numerical outputs, LLMs can dynamically adapt explanations, for example, by rephrasing content, simplifying language, or structuring reasoning incrementally based on user feedback, thereby supporting cognitive accessibility for diverse cognitive needs [15]. Practical demonstrations include LLMs explaining complex code, commenting on it for readability, and elucidating arcane error messages, even tailoring these explanations to specific user profiles (e.g., "explain as if I am a high school student") [28]. The `llms赋能ai可解释性综述与前沿` paper further posits that LLMs achieve this through their advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling dynamic, context-aware explanations, visualization of complex architectures, and counterfactual reasoning.

Beyond explaining *other* models, LLMs demonstrate a unique capacity for **self-explanation and generating insights into their own behaviors**. A foundational example is their ability to provide chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations for their decision-making processes, offering a form of intrinsic interpretability [15,30]. More advanced techniques, such as the `AMPLIFY` framework, leverage post-hoc explanations generated by LLMs themselves as corrective signals to improve their performance in complex tasks, illustrating how LLMs can make *themselves* more explainable or enhance their outputs based on generated rationales [24]. Furthermore, LLMs can automatically annotate and structure their internal thought processes, as shown by systems that classify reasoning steps, thereby generating insights into their complex behaviors for improved interpretability [3].

The integration of specific architectural enhancements and prompting strategies further empowers LLMs to generate structured and verifiable explanations. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** stands out by enabling LLMs to integrate relevant information from external knowledge bases, allowing them to identify and attribute the sources of their answers [20]. This functionality significantly enhances explainability by transparently linking generated content to verifiable "clinical evidence," making the model's reasoning traceable and its outputs verifiable, particularly in sensitive domains [20]. Another approach involves engineering LLMs with **specific personas**, which allows them to generate structured, multi-faceted analytical viewpoints. For instance, LLMs can provide research reviews from distinct perspectives (e.g., skeptical critique, contextualization, novelty assessment), enriching the transparency and interpretability of the evaluation process for human users [9]. The `InterpretableLLM` framework represents a comprehensive tool that, through its modular design and API service, facilitates the practical application of LLM explainability [32].

A crucial role for LLMs in advancing XAI is their utility in **evaluating AI systems and the quality of explanations themselves**. LLMs can serve as effective evaluators of their own outputs or those of other models, assessing plausibility and the quality of generated explanations [15]. LLM-based evaluators, for example, can not only assign quality scores but also generate detailed textual explanations for these scores, articulating the rationale, strengths, and weaknesses observed (e.g., syntax errors, logical flaws) [29]. This capacity to articulate *why* a particular assessment was made transforms the evaluation process into a more transparent and understandable endeavor, a capability empirically validated by human teachers who found such LLM-generated explanations to be reasonable [21]. This demonstrates how LLMs can effectively play human roles in XAI, automating tasks that typically require significant human involvement and expertise [8]. Furthermore, LLMs like ChatGPT ADA have demonstrated the ability to autonomously perform complex XAI analyses, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), identifying influential features for machine learning models and generating explainability metrics that experts found plausible [19]. Beyond post-hoc explanations, LLMs can even enhance the design of intrinsically interpretable models, such as in the Aug-imodels framework, where LLMs leverage their learned knowledge during the fitting process (not inference) to improve feature representations or generate feature expansions for interpretable models like Aug-Linear and Aug-Tree, thereby boosting performance without sacrificing transparency [16].

The pervasive influence of LLMs as tools for XAI is prompting the design of "explanation-aware architectures and workflows" where LLMs are integral to generating and improving explanations [15]. This heralds emerging opportunities for explanation techniques in the LLM era, emphasizing human-centered approaches that cater to how individuals process and utilize information [2,26]. The unique contributions of LLMs lie in their unparalleled natural language generation capabilities, scalability, and adaptability, allowing them to transform technical model outputs into diverse, user-tailored, and actionable explanations. While traditional XAI methods often struggle with generating fluent and context-rich narratives, LLMs inherently excel in this domain, offering a powerful complement to existing interpretability techniques.
### 7.6 Augmenting Interpretable Models with LLMs
The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel approaches to achieve explainability, often by integrating their powerful representational capabilities with inherently interpretable model structures. This hybrid paradigm seeks to leverage the advanced knowledge acquired by LLMs while maintaining the transparency and efficiency typically associated with simpler models, thereby bridging the gap between model complexity and trust [15,31].

A prominent framework in this domain is **Augmented-interpretable models (Aug-imodels)**, which strategically employs LLMs *during the model fitting phase but not during inference* [16]. This unique methodological separation is crucial for achieving complete transparency and significant efficiency gains, differentiating Aug-imodels from traditional black-box LLMs and purely post-hoc interpretability methods. Unlike black-box LLMs, which provide predictions without inherent insight into their decision-making process, or post-hoc techniques like LIME and SHAP that approximate explanations after a model has made a prediction, Aug-imodels produce models whose internal mechanisms are directly understandable and whose explanations are intrinsic to their structure. The primary benefits of this approach are substantial speed and memory improvements at inference time, alongside a high degree of interpretability [16].

The Aug-imodels framework offers specific instantiations tailored to different interpretable model types:
*   **Aug-Linear**: This variant augments a linear model by extracting "decoupled embeddings" from a pre-trained LLM, such as a fine-tuned BERT, for individual ngrams [16]. The model form is expressed as $g(E) = \beta + w^T \sum_i \phi(x_i)$, where $\phi(x_i)$ represents the fixed-size embedding generated by the LLM for ngram $x_i$ [16]. This allows the linear model to learn interpretable coefficients for rich, LLM-informed features.
*   **Aug-Tree**: For decision tree structures, Aug-Tree utilizes an LLM (e.g., GPT-3 API) to generate "feature expansions" [16]. Specifically, for a given keyphrase at a split node, the LLM generates a set of semantically similar ngrams via a prompt (e.g., "Generate 100 concise phrases that are very similar to the keyphrase: {keyphrase}"). These generated ngrams are then filtered and incorporated into the decision split as a disjunction, enriching the tree's expressiveness while maintaining its inherent interpretability [16].

Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of Aug-imodels. Both Aug-Linear and Aug-Tree consistently outperform their non-augmented, interpretable counterparts across various text-classification datasets, including Emotion, Financial Phrasebank, SST2, and Rotten Tomatoes [16]. Notably, Aug-Linear has shown superior performance compared to GPT-J (a 6-billion parameter LLM) and, for multi-class tasks, even GPT-3 (a 175-billion parameter LLM), despite possessing approximately "10,000x fewer parameters" [16]. While a fine-tuned BERT may still slightly outperform Aug-Linear by 4%-6% in accuracy, the significant gains in interpretability and efficiency present a compelling trade-off for practical applications [16].

A critical advantage of Aug-imodels lies in their unparalleled efficiency. These models achieve a ">1000x speed/memory improvement for inference compared to LLMs" [16]. For instance, Aug-Linear leads to a "1000x reduction in model size" when compared to BERT, resulting in "nearly instantaneous" inference times [16]. Furthermore, the interpretability of Aug-imodels is highly faithful; Aug-Linear's coefficients are exact and demonstrably more faithful than post-hoc methods like LIME and SHAP [16]. These coefficients are semantically reasonable, exhibiting strong correlations with human-labeled sentiment scores (Spearman $\rho = 0.63$ for bigrams, $\rho = 0.71$ for trigrams) [16]. Similarly, Aug-Tree's LLM-generated ngram expansions achieve high human evaluation scores, averaging over 4 on a 1-5 scale for semantic match [16]. The practical utility of Aug-Linear extends to domain-specific applications, evidenced by its superior performance over a black-box BERT baseline in predicting voxel responses in a natural-language fMRI study, thereby aiding in the interpretation of brain region activities [16].

The strategy employed by Aug-imodels resonates with broader research efforts exploring how LLMs can serve as a valuable resource for augmenting simpler, more interpretable systems. For example, Li et al. (2023b) introduced a multi-task learning framework where smaller language models (SLMs) are trained using explanations generated by LLMs, thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities [24]. This demonstrates LLMs acting as a powerful source of knowledge or "features" to empower other models. Similarly, Pan et al. (2023) proposed leveraging LLMs to build or refine interpretable knowledge bases through LLM-augmented knowledge graphs, structuring LLM knowledge for better transparency [24]. Another hybrid approach, DSR-LM (Zhang et al., 2023), integrates differentiable symbolic reasoning with pre-trained LLMs, improving logical reasoning accuracy by incorporating an inherently interpretable symbolic module for deductive reasoning [24]. These works collectively highlight a trend towards synergistically combining the pattern recognition and knowledge encoding strengths of LLMs with the transparency of other model types. In contrast, some comprehensive reviews of LLM interpretability do not delve into frameworks that specifically utilize LLMs during training to enhance simpler, inherently interpretable models without relying on the LLM for inference, nor do they cover methods for leveraging LLM knowledge for feature expansion or embedding generation, thus accentuating the unique contribution of Aug-imodels and related hybrid approaches [30].

Despite their strengths, Aug-imodels possess certain limitations. Their application is currently contingent on the availability of an effective LLM for the specific task or domain [16]. Furthermore, due to their simpler transparent model forms, Aug-imodels "cannot capture some complex interactions that LLMs can model" [16], representing a trade-off between complete transparency and the full predictive power of opaque, highly complex LLMs. Future research could explore methods to mitigate these limitations, such as developing techniques to transfer knowledge from LLMs to interpretable models more comprehensively or devising new interpretable model structures capable of capturing a broader range of complex interactions while maintaining efficiency and transparency.
### 7.7 Hybrid Human-AI Explainability Systems
Hybrid human-AI explainability systems represent a crucial future direction for Large Language Model (LLM) explainability, integrating the analytical power and efficiency of LLMs with indispensable human expertise [15,31]. This approach strategically leverages LLMs for initial analysis and efficiency gains, while meticulously reserving the "irreducible tasks of final judgment" for humans, particularly in scenarios demanding ethical considerations, nuanced interpretation, or critical thinking [9,28]. A fundamental aspect of these systems is the necessity for LLM outputs to be presented in an understandable format, facilitating effective human oversight and ensuring the LLM's contribution is both explainable and controllable [11]. This vision aligns with Human-Centered XAI, which emphasizes the paramount role of human interpretation, interaction, and accountability in collaboration with AI, rather than sole reliance on automated explanations [2,6].

The operational paradigm of hybrid systems typically involves a clear division of labor, where LLMs undertake the "exhaustive, time-consuming analytical work," thereby allowing human experts to concentrate on higher-level cognitive functions [9,28]. For instance, LLMs can accelerate routine tasks such as generating structured critiques, formulating hypotheses for code errors (as seen in AutoSD by Kang et al. (2023)), or performing initial quality assessments, which "frees human experts to focus on... final judgment, strategic direction, and creative insight" [9,21,24]. In specific applications, LLMs like DocOA can synthesize complex medical information and generate personalized treatment plans, enabling physicians to evaluate the rationale and accuracy based on identified references, thereby maintaining human oversight and ultimate decision-making authority [20]. Similarly, in the context of coding, LLMs can assist in generating code, but humans equipped with "critical thinking skills" and foundational knowledge in "coding, statistics and mathematics" are essential to "interpret LLM-generated code" and evaluate its accuracy [28].

A prime example of a hybrid human-AI explainability system is found in the domain of LLM evaluation. Here, LLMs can efficiently handle routine evaluations, performing the initial "time-consuming analytical work" for quality assessment, particularly during the early developmental stages of NLP systems [21]. This allows human experts to provide critical oversight, calibrate LLM performance, and concentrate on more complex or nuanced cases, reviewing LLM-generated explanations to ensure alignment and quality [9,21]. The importance of a "human in the loop" is underscored by the observation that LLMs may not always perform optimally in domain-specific tasks or require verification in critical situations [29]. This hybrid approach ensures that human feedback, which remains crucial for systems intended for human users, complements the LLM's efficiency, creating a more effective and trustworthy evaluation process [21].

Beyond evaluation, various systems demonstrate sophisticated integration of human and AI capabilities. The Aug-Linear model, for example, employs a two-step prediction procedure where it transparently handles "easy samples" with high confidence, while "difficult samples" are "relegated to a black-box model," implicitly reserving human expertise for these challenging cases [16]. In clinical research, ChatGPT ADA performs complex ML model development and initial explainability analysis (e.g., SHAP), yet a seasoned data scientist must review and re-implement the code and analysis for accuracy and validity, particularly due to concerns about the LLM's "black-box" nature [19]. The NeuroBreak system, designed to uncover LLM jailbreaking mechanisms, exemplifies a hybrid approach by combining automated multi-granular analysis with an interactive visual interface, enabling AI security experts to explore findings, formulate hypotheses, and guide targeted fine-tuning [18]. Similarly, the SAX4BPM framework integrates human-designed "causal process execution views" with the LLM's generative capacity, with user studies confirming that human perception and feedback are central to assessing and refining AI-generated explanations [4].

The success of these hybrid systems hinges on fostering a "shared language of trust between humans and machines" and facilitating "cooperative reasoning" [15]. Frameworks like TAXAL emphasize explainability as an "adaptive, trustworthy dialogue" embedded in sociotechnical systems, incorporating "User training aids" and "adaptive feedback loops that build trust and improve decision-making literacy" [15]. The SoS-ML framework further illustrates this by integrating real-time human feedback and "Concept Agents" that act as "scaffolding" to bridge the gap between AI and human cognition, allowing AI agents to detect biases (e.g., gender bias in salary prediction) and present "testament" to human experts for judgment and corrective action [17]. This represents an augmentation of human expertise where humans retain "final judgment, strategic direction, and critical thinking" [17,32]. Future directions suggest transforming passive explanations into active guidance mechanisms, such as "reasoning knobs" that allow humans to steer and validate the LLM's multi-step thought process in real-time, moving beyond mere oversight to active collaboration [3]. While most papers advocate for integrating human expertise with LLM capabilities for explainability, some research focuses broadly on human involvement and critical thinking in AI applications, without explicitly detailing hybrid explainability systems [34]. This highlights a distinction between general human-in-the-loop applications and those specifically designed to integrate human and AI capabilities for generating and interpreting explanations.

In summary, hybrid human-AI explainability systems are characterized by their pragmatic allocation of tasks: LLMs for efficient analytical processing and explanation generation, and humans for critical oversight, validation, and final decision-making in complex or ethically sensitive contexts. This collaborative model, supported by interdisciplinary efforts [31], ensures that LLM capabilities augment human intelligence rather than replace it, fostering trust and accountability in AI systems. The trajectory of this field points towards increasingly interactive and adaptive systems where human-AI collaboration evolves into a more symbiotic and guided reasoning process.
### 7.8 Structured Output and Persona-based Reasoning
The pursuit of explainable AI for Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly emphasizes the generation of structured outputs and the adoption of persona-based reasoning. These methodologies enhance transparency, interpretability, and the overall trustworthiness of LLM decisions by transforming opaque processes into comprehensible, actionable insights [15]. Structured output enables the systematic presentation of information, while persona-based reasoning allows LLMs to deliver contextually relevant explanations from diverse analytical viewpoints.

Structured output is a cornerstone for rendering LLM reasoning transparent. Instead of free-form text, LLMs can be guided via detailed prompts to produce predefined formats, such as an "ANSWER" containing an "EXPLANATION" and a numerical "SCORE" for evaluation tasks [29]. This structured approach ensures that the LLM's assessment explicitly addresses specific criteria through step-by-step reasoning, including checks for syntax errors, comparisons to expected outputs, and evaluations based on predetermined standards [29]. Similarly, in assessment scenarios, while an LLM might initially generate free-form text, specific parsing rules can extract standardized metrics, such as a Likert scale rating converted into a numerical score, thereby transforming unstructured output into a quantifiable, comparable metric [21]. Beyond evaluations, structured output also manifests in highly interpretable models. For instance, the Aug-imodels framework prioritizes structured outputs by converting Aug-Linear models into a "dictionary of scalar coefficients" for each ngram, offering a quantifiable representation of the model’s logic. Aug-Tree models, meanwhile, provide a decision tree structure with explicit split conditions, enabling "complete inspection of a model’s decision-making process" [16]. In medical applications, systems like DocOA generate verifiable structures by presenting "corresponding references" and "clinical evidence" alongside answers, allowing professionals to "evaluate the rationale and accuracy of its response" [20]. Moreover, frameworks like InterpretableLLM generate structured diagnostic rationales and key influencing factors, while "human-centered narratives" break down risk factors with quantified weights, making complex predictions clear and organized [11,32]. The categorization of reasoning steps into functional roles like Problem Setup, Plan Generation, or Self Checking, as seen in some Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analyses, further exemplifies structured output by decomposing complex reasoning into distinct analytical components [3].

Persona-based reasoning complements structured output by enabling LLMs to tailor their explanations to specific audiences or roles, thereby providing contextualized and multi-faceted insights. Prompts can guide LLMs to adopt distinct explanatory styles, such as "explain as if I am a high school student" or in the style of "patients or professional doctors," demonstrating an ability to adapt the output for diverse needs and improve understanding [20,28]. The TAXAL framework formalizes this through "role-sensitive explanation strategies" and "Explanation Role Routing," allowing interfaces to dynamically adjust explanation granularity based on user profiles. This includes providing compliance justification logs for regulators while offering accessible summaries for consumers, or tailoring medical explanations for "Doctor-Centered" versus "Patient-Centered" needs, thereby ensuring appropriately structured information delivery for each stakeholder [15]. The SoS-ML framework explicitly leverages a "Multi-Agent (Persona-like) Design," where distinct types of agents (e.g., Data Agents, Concept Agents) contribute specialized "viewpoints" to decision-making and explanation. For instance, in a hypertension management system, subsystems trained on gender-specific data act as specialized "personas" for bias detection, providing "distinct analytical viewpoints" and addressing subjectivity [17]. The comprehensive "explanation log" generated by SoS-ML is structured to serve various stakeholders, offering an "Overview for AI end-users," "System Information for AI Developers," and an "Appendix for Interested Party," with a fine-tuned LLM acting as a Language Acquisition Device (LAD) to convert technical inference into human-readable, structured formats [17].

The synergy between persona-based prompting and structured output is particularly effective in complex assessment tasks, such as academic peer review. The "LLM Triumvirate" for peer review exemplifies this by employing distinct personas—Guardian, Synthesizer, and Innovator—each assigned an "adversarial role" to stress-test a paper from a unique critical perspective [9]. These personas are instructed to populate a "standardized review form" rather than generating free-form text, which transforms the review into a "structured data set" presenting "three distinct analytical viewpoints" to human editors. This approach significantly improves consistency and insightfulness in the review process [9]. In a broader context of evaluation, persona-based prompting, such as telling an LLM "(You are a human worker hired to rate the story fragment)," has been experimentally shown to influence its scoring behavior and the subsequent structured evaluation output [21]. This indicates that LLMs as evaluators can leverage persona-based prompts to generate specific scores with justifications, facilitating human review and understanding of their reasoning process [9,21].

**Commonalities, Differences, and Future Trajectories:**
The common thread across these approaches is the commitment to demystifying LLM operations, moving towards more transparent and accountable AI. Both structured output and persona-based reasoning aim to facilitate human comprehension and trust by delivering information in an organized, contextually appropriate manner. However, subtle differences exist: some research emphasizes structured output primarily for its clarity and inspectability, often independent of explicit persona-driven generation [3,16]. In contrast, other studies integrate persona-like mechanisms to actively shape and generate these structured outputs, specifically to cater to different stakeholders or to offer multi-dimensional analyses [9,15,17,20]. The "LLM Triumvirate" stands out by introducing an adversarial component to persona roles, pushing beyond mere stylistic adaptation to critical, multi-angled assessment [9]. While the TAXAL framework aligns with the principles of role-based adaptation, its critical analysis highlights that it does not explicitly use the term "persona-based reasoning" or detail specific triumvirate implementations, indicating a spectrum in the conceptualization and application of these ideas.

Looking forward, the future trajectories of structured output and persona-based reasoning involve deeper integration into sophisticated multi-agent LLM architectures, allowing for even more nuanced and specialized analyses. Further research will likely focus on standardizing structured output formats across various domains to facilitate interoperability and automated processing. Advanced persona design could incorporate explicit ethical considerations, robust bias detection mechanisms, and sophisticated conflict resolution strategies within multi-persona interactions. Quantifying the precise impact of specific personas on factors such as decision-making consistency, bias reduction, and human trust and comprehension will be crucial for validating their effectiveness. Ultimately, exploring dynamic persona switching or collaborative persona interactions could lead to even more comprehensive and adaptive explanation capabilities for complex LLM behaviors.
### 7.9 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Source Attribution
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique to enhance both the performance and, critically, the explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing verifiable sources for their outputs [8,20]. This approach addresses key challenges such as hallucinations and the incorporation of up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge, thereby bolstering the accuracy, reliability, and transparency of LLM responses through explicit source attribution [8]. RAG functions as an "inference-stage explanation technique," allowing LLMs to generate responses grounded in external knowledge bases rather than solely relying on their internal parametric memory [8].

The core mechanism of RAG involves integrating an LLM's generative capabilities with a dynamic retrieval system that accesses specific information from external knowledge bases [20]. This process typically converts user queries into "text vectors" (embeddings) to calculate "semantic similarity" with documents in the external knowledge base, subsequently retrieving the "most relevant" information to augment the LLM's prompt [8,20]. Beyond direct augmentation, RAG-like mechanisms can also be employed in post-processing. For instance, He et al. (2022) proposed "Rethinking with Retrieval," an LLM post-processing method that refines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paths using external knowledge, implicitly providing a form of grounding and source attribution [24]. Similarly, Pan et al. (2023) introduced "KG-augmented LLM," which leverages explicit, structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to combat hallucination and enhance explainability, signifying another strategy for retrieval and augmentation [24].

RAG's utility for source attribution manifests across various specialized domains. In the medical field, as exemplified by DocOA, RAG plays a crucial role in enabling LLMs to "identify the clinical evidence upon which its answers are based" [20]. This capability is paramount for medical professionals, allowing them to evaluate the rationale and accuracy of LLM-generated information by "accurately identify the corresponding references" [20]. DocOA utilized OpenAI's retrieval function with an optimized JSON data structure to dynamically pull relevant data for osteoarthritis-related queries, thereby significantly improving explainability, accuracy, and reliability while providing "efficient and cost-effective access to updated external data" [20].

Another critical application is in scientific peer review, where RAG can bridge knowledge gaps and ensure LLMs are "knowledgeable about the most recent scientific literature" [9]. By enabling LLMs to access "relevant PDFs" directly uploaded by reviewers or authors, RAG provides "direct access to the specific context and related work necessary for a thorough evaluation" [9]. This not only enhances the LLM's capacity for transparently citing sources but also facilitates evidence-based critiques, which is fundamental to the integrity of scientific review [9]. Across these domains, the common advantage of RAG lies in its ability to provide verifiable sources, directly contributing to increased trustworthiness and explainability of LLM outputs.

The effectiveness of RAG and its source attribution capabilities are quantitatively assessed through specific metrics. **Faithfulness** measures the "factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context" by creating statements from the LLM's output and verifying them against the retrieved documents, penalizing claims unsupportable by the context [29]. This metric directly evaluates the LLM's adherence to its sources. **Context Relevancy** assesses "how relevant retrieved contexts are to the question," thus evaluating the quality of the sources provided for attribution [29]. Lastly, **Context Recall** measures the completeness of the retrieved context by comparing it against an annotated ground truth answer, indicating whether all relevant source information was successfully retrieved [29]. Collectively, these metrics provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the degree to which generated answers are grounded in provided contexts and the overall quality of those contexts.

Despite its advantages, RAG is not without limitations. Its efficacy is "contingent upon factors such as the size and quality of the data, retrieval techniques used, and the underlying architecture of the LLM" [20]. A significant deficiency arises from the semantic similarity-based retrieval process, which can be "uncertain because the most appropriate answer does not necessarily yield the highest similarity score" [20]. This limitation can lead to retrieving "only a portion of the information" or, more critically, missing "key information," potentially causing the LLM to generate incorrect yet plausible answers [20]. In the DocOA system, for example, 111 RAG failures were observed, accounting for 12.4% of its inaccurate answers, underscoring the challenges in ensuring consistently accurate and complete retrieval [20].

In summary, RAG represents a powerful paradigm shift for enhancing LLM explainability and trustworthiness by rooting responses in verifiable external information. While its application spans diverse fields like medicine and peer review, offering consistent benefits in transparency and reliability, the accuracy of its source attribution remains susceptible to the quality of retrieved data and the limitations of semantic similarity. Future research directions should focus on improving the robustness of retrieval mechanisms beyond simple semantic matching, potentially by incorporating more sophisticated reasoning or context understanding into the retrieval phase, and integrating structured knowledge as explored by "KG-augmented LLM" [24]. Addressing these limitations will be crucial for solidifying RAG's role as a cornerstone of explainable AI in LLMs.

The rapid evolution and widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative yet challenging landscape for Explainable AI (XAI). While LLMs demonstrate unprecedented capabilities, their inherent complexity, emergent behaviors, and massive scale introduce significant "black box" opacity, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional XAI approaches [1,2,26]. Bridging this complexity with the imperative for human trust and responsible AI development defines the core of future directions and open challenges in LLM explainability [31].

A foundational challenge lies in the current absence of ground truth explanations, benchmark datasets, and unified standards for designing and evaluating effective XAI algorithms for LLMs [25,31]. This deficiency profoundly hinders the rigorous assessment of explanation faithfulness and fidelity, making it difficult to objectively compare various XAI methods or ascertain what constitutes a "good" explanation [30]. Compounding this is the pervasive "exoplanations" challenge, where LLM-generated narratives, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, often prioritize plausibility and communicative clarity over faithfully representing the model's true internal decision-making process [7,15]. This disconnect can lead to "false trust" and incorrect mental models of LLM capabilities, with significant implications for high-stakes applications [30,31].

The inherent architectural complexity of LLMs, characterized by billions of parameters and non-comparable layer representations, makes it exceedingly difficult to decompose contributions or infer precise neuron functionality, especially in proprietary models lacking transparency [10,18]. Furthermore, LLMs exhibit problematic emergent behaviors like "shortcut learning," hallucinations, and inherent biases stemming from training data, alongside issues like non-reproducibility and limitations in logical, temporal, or mathematical reasoning [25,29,33,34]. When LLMs function as evaluators, they introduce behavioral biases (e.g., positional bias, verbosity bias) and factual inaccuracies, further complicating their reliable application [21,29]. Moreover, the substantial computational demands of LLMs pose significant resource challenges for current XAI techniques, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability [30,33].

Addressing these multifaceted challenges necessitates a paradigm shift towards proactive, human-centered, and interdisciplinary XAI. Key future directions include:

Firstly, **deepening our understanding of LLM internal mechanisms** through architectural, causal, and mechanistic interpretability [2]. This involves unraveling *how* specific behaviors and emergent capabilities (e.g., in-context learning, CoT) arise from the Transformer architecture [30], tracing neural circuits to understand computational processes like planning or multilingual processing [12], and identifying genuine causal links between inputs, internal states, and outputs to move beyond mere correlations [11]. Developing "reasoning knobs" that allow humans to guide AI reasoning processes is a promising avenue [3].

Secondly, **enhancing evaluation methodologies** is paramount. This requires establishing standardized evaluation measures, robust benchmarks (including domain-specific ones), and transferable methods to assess explanation quality, utility, and human comprehensibility across diverse applications and contexts [2,15,31]. Crucially, human-centric metrics must be developed to capture trust calibration, comprehension accuracy, and counterfactual plausibility, moving beyond technical fidelity alone [15]. The evaluation of LLMs as evaluators also requires new rigorous standards, including human-in-the-loop validation and strategies to mitigate inherent biases [21,29].

Thirdly, **integrating proactive XAI for robustness, safety, and ethical alignment** is critical. XAI must shift from being a reactive diagnostic tool to a core, preventative element throughout the LLM development lifecycle [17,24]. This includes developing techniques for proactive bias and anomaly detection, creating "semantic monitors" to flag deviations from ethical guidelines, and leveraging "Predictive XAI" to assess risks like hallucination [12,15]. Frameworks like SoS-ML and LoBOX emphasize embedding responsible AI principles and institutional oversight to align LLMs with human values and objectives [15,17].

Fourthly, **fostering efficient and scalable explainability** for resource-intensive LLMs is essential. This involves developing lightweight explanation mechanisms, optimizing computation processes through techniques like incremental and streaming explanations, and exploring "explainability-aware compression" or "interpretable distillation" to create smaller, transparent proxy models [16,32]. Strategies for cost-effective LLM deployment, such as leveraging pre-trained models with RAG, also indirectly support scalable XAI [20].

Finally, **embracing interdisciplinary approaches and novel frameworks** is paramount. Effective XAI necessitates integrating insights from philosophy, cognitive science, and social sciences to create contextually relevant, human-aligned, and inherently interpretable systems [2,17,31]. Frameworks like SoS-ML, TAXAL, and SAX4BPM illustrate diverse integrations, from grounding explanations in human cognition to addressing socio-political dimensions and application-specific needs [4,15,17]. This collaborative effort, coupled with the development of methodologies to quantify human perception and embed ethical considerations from design, is crucial for advancing both LLM capabilities and the XAI field in unison [6,24]. The ultimate goal is to achieve explanations that are "cognitively accessible when needed, operationally actionable when demanded, and causally faithful when scrutiny requires it" [15].
### 8.1 Technical and Foundational Research Gaps
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm in AI, yet it has simultaneously unearthed a complex array of technical and foundational research gaps in explainability. These challenges stem directly from the unique characteristics of LLMs, such as their massive scale and emergent behaviors, which necessitate a re-evaluation of traditional Explainable AI (XAI) approaches [1,2,26]. Bridging the inherent complexity of these models with the imperative for human trust represents a significant hurdle [31]. Consequently, there is a recognized need to redefine XAI goals for LLMs, shifting towards human-centered strategies that move beyond mere technical explanations to more practical and verifiable objectives [6,8].

A primary and pervasive challenge lies in the fundamental absence of ground truth explanations and benchmark datasets for LLMs, which severely hinders the design and rigorous evaluation of accurate XAI algorithms [25]. Without such benchmarks, it becomes problematic to ascertain the faithfulness and fidelity of explanations or to objectively compare various XAI methods [30]. This deficiency is compounded by a lack of unified standards for designing and evaluating effective explanations, leading to ambiguities in what constitutes a "good" explanation and making quality assessment difficult [22,31,32]. For multi-agent systems, the problem extends to insufficient evaluation metrics to assess agent collaboration, context-specific performance, and modular error tracing [17]. Furthermore, empirical evaluation gaps persist, with frameworks like TAXAL explicitly noting a lack of quantitative assessment across metrics or datasets, highlighting the need for application using established benchmarks such as ERASER and TruthfulQA [15].

Compounding the evaluation challenges is the unresolved issue of explanation faithfulness. Model-generated explanations, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, often do not faithfully represent the LLM's true internal decision-making process, leading to potentially unfaithful or even unrealistic explanations that align with predictions but can result in errors [12,22,30,34]. This inherent inability of LLMs to truly explain their own mechanical processes through self-generated text often creates an "illusion" of understanding rather than genuine insight [7]. The field grapples with an unresolved trade-off between the technical accuracy (faithfulness) of an explanation and its communicative clarity (plausibility) to users [4,15]. Moreover, explanations frequently prove "too complex for non-technical stakeholders," indicating a gap in translating intricate technical details into broadly understandable forms [24].

The core of these limitations often lies in the "massive architectural complexity and vast parameter scale" of LLMs, which makes it exceedingly difficult to decompose contributions from different layers or infer precise neuron functionality [8,10,12,22,31,34]. This challenge is further exacerbated by the "non-comparable layer representations" observed across different layers, residing in distinct semantic spaces, which complicates efforts to attribute layered contributions or understand internal mechanisms [18,22]. The proprietary nature of many state-of-the-art models further entrenches this "black-box opacity," limiting transparency into their internal workings [17,19].

The enigma of LLM's emergent capabilities presents another significant hurdle, as the sources of these surprising new abilities (e.g., few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought prompting) remain obscure, particularly for proprietary models where architectural details and training data are undisclosed [10,22,25,30,32,34]. Alongside this, problematic behaviors like "shortcut learning" persist in both fine-tuning and prompting paradigms, affecting model generalization and efficiency [22,25]. Hallucinations, where LLMs confidently provide incorrect information, represent an unresolved issue affecting factual correctness and internal consistency [4,25,28,34]. Other critical reliability concerns include inherent biases stemming from training data skewed towards certain demographics and languages [28,33], and the non-reproducibility of responses for regular users, which poses a significant challenge for scientific reliability [28]. The struggle of LLMs with mathematics and logic also points to foundational deficiencies [29].

Methodological challenges include the difficulties in conducting comprehensive comparisons between explainability in traditional fine-tuning and prompt-based paradigms, despite their distinct performance characteristics for in-distribution and out-of-distribution data [22,25,30]. Furthermore, LLMs impose substantial computational demands for training and execution, requiring significant resources and making many traditional attribution techniques impractical [30,32,33,34]. The efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is contingent on data quality and retrieval techniques, with semantic similarity-based queries sometimes failing to retrieve the most appropriate information, leading to incorrect answers despite the aim for explainability [20]. There is also a persistent "data deficiency" concerning multimodal, multilingual, and graph data, hindering the development of comprehensive LLMs [34]. This extends to generalizability concerns across diverse domains, real-world validation, and difficulties in integrating and adapting domain-specific knowledge, especially for highly technical fields with specialized terminology [11,15,19,20,33]. Traditional transparent models, such as linear models and decision trees, are limited in capturing complex interactions that LLMs can model and often fail to learn about unobserved n-grams, underscoring the need for augmented approaches [16].

Specifically, when LLMs function as evaluators, several distinct technical and methodological limitations emerge. These include issues with factual inaccuracies, as LLMs may possess incorrect factual knowledge limiting their suitability for fact-intensive evaluation tasks [21]. Behavioral biases are also prevalent, stemming from training objectives (e.g., safety alignment leading to skewed judgments) and including positional bias, verbosity bias, and self-enhancement bias [28,29]. Reproducibility issues arise due to frequent model updates, leading to inconsistent evaluations, particularly in less-aligned models. Discrepancies in the interpretation of evaluation criteria between LLMs and humans further complicate their role as reliable evaluators [10,21]. Moreover, LLMs exhibit sensitivity to prompts, requiring robust prompting strategies to ensure consistent and reliable results across various instruction formulations [19,21]. They also face limitations in processing visual cues in task instructions (e.g., formatting) and inherently lack the capacity for genuine emotional assessment, making them inappropriate for tasks requiring subjective emotional judgment [21].

Addressing these multifaceted challenges necessitates focused research directions. It is critical to develop advanced XAI methods capable of diagnosing issues like shortcut learning and contribute to the creation of more efficient and inherently interpretable model architectures [25]. Future work must also address the non-comparability of representations across distinct layers, a key impediment to deeper mechanistic understanding [18,25]. The field should move towards redefining the goals of explainability for LLMs, aligning them with practical, human-centered objectives [6,8]. This involves developing comprehensive evaluation metrics for complex, multi-agent systems and fostering greater community engagement in open-source projects for collaborative development and validation [17,24]. Furthermore, research into more autonomous and cost-effective LLM agents is essential to overcome current complexities and expenses [9], alongside improving multimodal data handling and domain-specific knowledge integration for more robust and context-aware explanations [11].
### 8.2 Architectural, Causal, and Mechanistic Interpretability
Understanding the internal workings of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing architectural, causal, and mechanistic interpretability. These three interconnected paradigms are crucial for bridging the gap between LLM opacity and human comprehension, ultimately fostering trust and enabling robust control over these complex systems [2]. The focus shifts from merely observing input-output behavior to dissecting *how* decisions are made, *why* certain behaviors emerge, and *where* specific functions are instantiated within the model's architecture [31].

**I. Unveiling LLM Architecture: From Components to Emergent Capabilities**

Architectural interpretability delves into understanding how the structural components of LLMs, particularly the Transformer architecture, contribute to their overall behavior and emergent capabilities. Researchers advocate for "model architecture innovation" to build inherently explainable AI systems that balance performance with transparency [11]. A critical research direction involves investigating the "origins and mechanisms of LLMs' emergent capabilities," such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, from both "model architecture" and "training data" perspectives [22,30]. This includes identifying "specific architectural features" that give rise to these abilities and determining the "minimum model complexity and scale" required [30].

For instance, identifying "Thought Anchors" as structured reasoning blocks within LLMs directly investigates how specific internal architectural components, namely "Receiver Heads" within the attention mechanism, consistently focus on and "broadcast" these anchors [3]. Ablation studies reveal that these Receiver Heads, concentrated in deeper layers, are crucial for reasoning accuracy, offering mechanistic insights into how models prioritize and propagate information during multi-step inference [3]. Similarly, the "functional interpretability" paradigm proposes designing AI systems with inherent transparency by focusing on the modular design and clear functions of component groups (functional units/ROIs) rather than individual neurons, thus providing a foundation for embedded explainability [17].

Furthermore, understanding architectural distinctions is key, as different Transformer architectures (e.g., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder models) pose unique challenges and exhibit specific emergent behaviors like in-context learning [27]. Beyond understanding functional components, architectural interpretability also addresses inherent limitations and inefficiencies. "Shortcut learning," prevalent in both fine-tuning and prompting paradigms, and "attention redundancy" are widespread issues across LLMs, indicating that many attention heads and other components can be pruned with minimal performance impact [10,22,30]. Research into these areas can inform model compression techniques while potentially enhancing explainability [30].

**II. Mechanistic Interpretability: Tracing the Neural Circuits of LLMs**

Mechanistic interpretability focuses on understanding the internal workings of LLMs at a granular level, examining individual neurons, their connections, and the computational graphs they form to elucidate their "biology" [12,13,25]. This approach aims to trace neural circuits to understand how specific computations are performed. Techniques such as "Circuit Tracing" involve replacing dense neural network components with sparse, interpretable alternatives to map out internal computations, allowing researchers to observe how LLMs plan for tasks like poetry generation, perform mathematical calculations, or process multilingual concepts via shared neural representations [12].

While still "requiring in-depth research" for LLMs, mechanistic interpretability remains a promising avenue for elucidating their internal workings [30]. For instance, it has been applied to "unveil the internal jailbreak mechanisms in LLMs" by providing "mechanistic insights" at the neuron level, focusing on "functional interdependence" and "collaborative mechanisms" among neurons [18]. Future research in this domain suggests exploring "nonlinear probing techniques, like kernel-based classifiers or neural probes," to model more complex decision boundaries and improve the fidelity of mechanistic understanding [18]. Understanding how CoT prompts affect LLM behavior and performance also directly relates to gaining deeper architectural and mechanistic insights [25].

**III. Causal Interpretability: Establishing True Explanations and Enabling Intervention**

Causal interpretability is paramount for moving beyond mere correlations to identify and explain the genuine causal links between LLM inputs, internal states, and outputs [11,14]. This paradigm is essential for developing "causally sound" explanations and fostering an adaptive, trustworthy dialogue with AI systems, particularly in the context of agentic LLMs [4,15].

Current research actively explores methods for identifying causal structures [24]. Techniques include "causal attention suppression," which measures direct causal dependencies between sentences during reasoning, and "causal intervention," where manipulating specific neural pathways demonstrates a causal understanding of how internal mechanisms affect outcomes [3,12]. For instance, methods like perturbation-based attribution, gradient-based association analysis, and interactive tools such as "Break the Neurons" allow for quantifying "causal relationships" and performing causal validation of internal mechanisms [18]. For agentic LLMs, future research aims to enhance causal tracing through methods like counterfactual reasoning, causal mediation analysis, and neuron activation ablation, which provide stronger evidence of model behavior under manipulation [15]. These methods are crucial for explaining agentic dynamics, including goal formation, subtask decomposition, and multi-agent coordination, by incorporating temporal traces, goal provenance graphs, and action-based causal justifications [15].

The importance of causal reasoning is underscored by the observation that LLMs often "take shortcuts when making predictions" due to lexical or positional biases, highlighting the need to understand underlying causal dependencies to improve generalization and robustness [30]. Furthermore, a notable deficiency in current LLMs is "causal hallucination" even with CoT, indicating that existing approaches for causal understanding remain insufficient and necessitate explicit integration of causal reasoning into XAI methods for more faithful and robust explanations [15,24]. Ultimately, dynamic analysis of the training process, shifting from "static snapshot interpretability to dynamic temporal analysis," is crucial to "reveal causal relationships" and critical stages in model development [30].

**IV. Addressing LLM Reasoning Limitations through XAI**

Despite their advanced capabilities, LLMs exhibit notable weaknesses in complex reasoning domains. Specifically, they "do not have a notion of time" and are "not grounded in the spatial sense," making "temporal or spatial reasoning" challenging. Additionally, LLMs are "not very good in terms of mathematical reasoning" [33]. To address these fundamental research gaps, XAI tools and methodologies must be developed to pinpoint *why* LLMs fail in logical, mathematical, or spatio-temporal reasoning.

This involves dissecting LLM architectures, particularly the Transformer, to understand *how* and *where* emergent abilities arise and, conversely, where reasoning breakdowns occur [12]. Techniques like visual graph-based explanations for Chain-of-Thought processes can expose logical flaws, providing a clear diagnostic tool for model limitations. The goal is to transform insights from "Thought Anchors"—which are high-level anchoring points for emergent reasoning—into "reasoning knobs" for human-guided AI, enabling dynamic intervention to correct erroneous reasoning paths in real-time and optimize model training [3]. By deeply understanding these internal mechanisms, researchers can enhance the models' ability to represent and explain intricate relationships, moving towards a more robust and controllable AI.

In summary, advancing architectural, mechanistic, and causal interpretability is critical for anticipating the emergence of new LLM capabilities, understanding their roots, and rectifying their known weaknesses. This demands a holistic approach that integrates insights from all three interpretability paradigms, supported by quantitative evidence and critical appraisal of research results [15,31]. Future research trajectories emphasize a shift towards deeper understanding of internal mechanisms, dynamic temporal analysis, and the explicit integration of causal reasoning into XAI methods to achieve a balanced approach that prioritizes both performance and transparency [11,24,30].
### 8.3 Proactive XAI for Robustness, Safety, and Ethical Alignment
The increasing sophistication and widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate a proactive approach to Explainable AI (XAI) to ensure their robustness, safety, and ethical alignment. Explainability is paramount for controlling LLMs and mitigating their negative societal impacts, including bias, unfairness, misinformation, and social manipulation, thereby facilitating the development of ethical AI systems [10,15,31]. The integration of XAI, therefore, must move beyond a reactive diagnostic tool to become a core, preventative element throughout the LLM development lifecycle [2,8,17,24].

A primary driver for proactive XAI stems from the profound societal and ethical risks associated with unexplainable LLMs. These risks encompass their potential to generate misinformation, perpetuate biases, and facilitate social manipulation [14,30]. Persistent issues like "biases related to sex, gender, race, and religion" and the generation of "offensive or nonsensical output" (hallucinations) are critical concerns that directly impact trust and reliability [33,34]. For instance, LLMs can learn and perpetuate biases from training data, leading to skewed outcomes and stereotypical representations [28,34]. The potential for algorithmic bias from skewed foundational data, which might underrepresent certain patient groups or perpetuate imbalanced outcomes, is particularly acute in sensitive domains like healthcare [19]. Even LLMs trained for safety can exhibit behavioral biases, such as preference for positive responses, raising concerns about their neutrality as evaluators [21]. The phenomenon of hallucination, where LLMs produce factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs, significantly erodes user trust and underscores the need for robust explanation mechanisms [4,7].

Beyond bias and hallucination, other significant challenges include privacy protection, security against adversarial attacks, and broader ethical considerations. Privacy concerns are critical, with few studies adequately addressing data protection (anonymization, sanitization) and informed consent for personal data used in LLM training and application [11,19,31,34]. LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks like command and prompt injection, particularly in sensitive sectors such as political, military, financial, and medical domains, necessitating strengthened security measures [18,23]. Furthermore, critical ethical issues extend to academic integrity, intellectual property, accountability for LLM-generated content, and the substantial environmental impact of LLM training and usage [23,28]. The overarching challenge is to ensure that LLMs adhere to human values and objectives, functioning as intended and avoiding inappropriate outcomes, especially as models become more intricate and self-reliant [34].

To address these multifaceted challenges, developing proactive XAI techniques for bias and anomaly detection during LLM development and deployment is essential. This paradigm shift involves creating explanation methods capable of identifying potential biased pathways or "nonsensical" reasoning chains *before* they manifest in harmful outputs. Research could focus on using causal intervention techniques to pinpoint sensitive features influencing biased outputs, similar to how identifying "Thought Anchors" can reveal critical intervention points in an LLM's reasoning process, allowing for targeted modifications to enhance robustness and debug safety risks [3]. Such techniques enable researchers to track training data attribution or visualize attention patterns to reveal embedded biases like gender stereotypes or identify problematic associations encoded in the model's representations through probing classifiers [30].

Moreover, building "semantic monitors" that flag deviations from factual consistency or ethical guidelines during content generation would allow for early intervention and mitigation. Mechanistic interpretability contributes to this by providing a "deeper understanding of how these AI systems actually work," identifying underlying mechanisms for phenomena like hallucinations (e.g., separate recognition and recall circuits) to enable a more proactive approach to building robust and safe LLMs [12]. This aligns with the concept of "Predictive XAI," which uses attribution-derived features to train secondary classifiers that predict hallucination risk or safety violations, transforming XAI into a real-time monitoring tool for trust and safety [15].

Several frameworks and design principles advocate for this proactive stance. The **System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML)** framework, for instance, is proposed as a blueprint for embedding Responsible AI by balancing computational optimality with social values like transparency, fairness, and accountability [17]. SoS-ML proactively mitigates biases (e.g., gender bias) and risks by providing context-aware, evidence-based explanations, grounding AI reasoning in human values through insights from philosophy, cognitive science, and social sciences [17]. Transparency is positioned as a "central pillar of responsible AI," directly linking XAI to ensuring safety and ethical alignment [2,27]. Similarly, the LoBOX framework is introduced as a governance pathway to ethically manage the inherent opacity of foundation models, ensuring institutional oversight and accountability as a foundation for public trust [15]. In high-stakes applications, such as medical decision-making, approaches like Aug-imodels aim for "complete transparency" and interpretability to support robust, safe, and ethically aligned AI systems [16].

Evaluation and auditing also play a crucial role in proactive XAI. Implementing "strict model auditing, external oversight committees, and transparency regulations" can help mitigate risks [30]. Human evaluation metrics, such as "likelihood of possible harm" and "possibility of bias," directly contribute to assessing and improving LLM safety and ethical alignment [20]. Moreover, it is critical to address biases within evaluation metrics themselves, with proposed strategies like Multiple Evidence Calibration and Balanced Position Calibration for LLM evaluators to ensure more ethically aligned assessment processes [29].

Future research must continue to develop methodologies and tools that embed ethical considerations and human welfare from the design phase [11,17]. This includes establishing "principles for accountability" within XAI to ensure LLMs are aligned with societal norms and human well-being [6]. Ongoing challenges involve adapting to dynamic adversarial interactions for enhanced security [18], balancing the need for explanations with privacy protection [11], and addressing the tension between commercial interests and unbiased scientific deliberation [19]. Ultimately, proactive XAI is indispensable for fostering trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and enabling the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, particularly given their potential for broad social impact and the "unnecessary risks" they pose in downstream applications [1,26].
### 8.4 Enhancing Evaluation: Metrics, Benchmarks, and Interpretability
The efficacy of Large Language Model (LLM) explainability is fundamentally constrained by the absence of robust and standardized evaluation methodologies. A primary challenge identified across the literature is the "lack of effective correct explanations," stemming from inadequate standards for explanation design and inherent difficulties in their evaluation [10]. This deficiency underscores a critical consensus: explainability must be integrated as a core element throughout the LLM development lifecycle, rather than being treated as a post-hoc consideration, to ensure genuine transparency and accountability [24].

Current evaluation metrics and frameworks for LLM explanations exhibit significant limitations. Existing automatic evaluation metrics are widely considered insufficient for fully capturing the complexity of LLM explainability, particularly within conversational systems, highlighting an urgent need for human-understandable evaluation indicators [10,11,22]. Furthermore, there is a pronounced "lack of well-established evaluation criteria" for attention-based explanations, coupled with inconsistencies among existing metrics, such as DFFOT versus SUFF, which demonstrates a general inability to reliably assess the quality and impact of explanations [30]. Quantitative metrics often struggle to apply directly to natural language explanations due to their indirect relationship with model inputs, further complicated by fairness concerns in counterfactual and input reconstruction tests [30]. A major impediment to designing accurate explanation algorithms and reliably evaluating faithfulness and fidelity is the "inaccessibility of LLM's ground truth explanations" and the "absence of benchmark datasets for global explanations" [17,30]. Studies reveal that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations, despite their intuitive appeal, are "not always faithful representations of the model's actual reasoning" and can even "systematically misrepresent the true reasons" or be "factually unreliable," often favoring plausibility over genuine accuracy [12,24,28]. This underscores a significant gap in current methods for truly assessing the fidelity of explanations [13].

To address these profound challenges, there is a consistent and urgent call for the establishment of "standardized evaluation measures" and robust protocols across multiple papers [2,15,31,32]. This imperative extends to developing "transferable evaluation methods" that can reliably assess the quality, utility, and human comprehensibility of explanations across diverse LLM applications and user contexts [6].

Developing comprehensive evaluation methodologies necessitates a multi-faceted approach, encompassing shared benchmarks, human-centric metrics, and interdisciplinary collaboration. While some initial efforts exist, such as `ROSCOE` for stepwise reasoning (evaluating semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality) and `WHOOPS!` for visual common sense reasoning and explanation generation [24], these efforts highlight the nascent state of benchmark development. A critical research avenue involves the creation of domain-specific benchmarks, addressing the "absence of tailored benchmarks" in specialized fields. For instance, a novel multi-level assessment framework (GIQA, MOQA, TSQA, RCQA) combining objective and human evaluations (by physicians and patients) has been proposed for medical LLMs to assess criteria like accuracy, harm, bias, comprehension, retrieval, reasoning, and helpfulness [20]. This approach emphasizes a "comprehensive, multidimensional approach" for evaluating LLMs in clinical contexts [20]. Similarly, frameworks for identifying critical reasoning anchors using techniques like KL divergence for quantifying impact and Pearson correlation for consistency checks suggest potential for developing domain-specific benchmarks focusing on structural and causal fidelity in reasoning processes [3]. Expanding dataset scope to include emerging attack techniques, cross-lingual prompts, and user-generated examples is crucial for enhancing the robustness and applicability of evaluations to diverse threat scenarios [18].

Equally vital is the development of human-centric metrics that extend beyond technical faithfulness to capture human understanding, utility, and trust. The literature consistently advocates for evaluation indicators that truly reflect human understanding rather than merely technical fidelity [11,17,22]. This includes the development of "stakeholder-centered metrics" such as trust calibration, comprehension accuracy, and counterfactual plausibility [15]. Dynamic and outcome-driven evaluation protocols are proposed, which track user confidence, decision latency, and trust volatility, emphasizing task success and human feedback over mere agreement with ground truth [15]. User studies employing designated scales for perceived quality are crucial for refining these human-centric metrics and establishing standardized benchmarks for interpretability and fidelity that transcend automated scores [4]. However, challenges remain in addressing the "lack of interpretability" of some metrics and their inability to "capture subtle nuances in language" [29]. Interdisciplinary approaches are essential to validate the utility and trustworthiness of explanations for diverse stakeholders [2]. Novel metrics for Systems-of-Systems (SoS-ML) highlight specific areas for advancement, including Agent Collaboration Effectiveness, Context-Specific Performance, and Modular Error Tracing, to better align explanations with human cognitive processes and provide meaningful insights [17].

Finally, the field must confront the challenges associated with evaluating the evaluators themselves. Human evaluation, traditionally a cornerstone of interpretability research, is characterized by "instability" and "irreproducibility" [21]. The inherent inconsistent quality and variability in absolute scoring tendencies among human judges, exacerbated by frequent LLM model updates, necessitate the development of unified standards for LLM evaluation that account for model-specific biases and ensure consistency across different versions [21]. As LLMs increasingly act as evaluators, a "systematic study" is required to understand their behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses, including addressing biases such as positional, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases [29]. While LLM evaluators offer promise in addressing some human evaluation shortcomings, their domain-specific performance may be suboptimal [29]. Therefore, future research must advocate for developing new, rigorous standards for evaluating LLM evaluators, emphasizing comprehensive human-in-the-loop validation and the continued, critical role of human feedback in validating LLM-generated evaluations [21,29]. This integrated perspective is crucial for establishing robust and consistent evaluation methodologies that foster trust and reliability in LLM explanations.
### 8.5 Human-Centered and Contextualized Explainability
The advancement of explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly emphasizes a human-centered and contextualized approach, recognizing that explanations serve as a crucial bridge between model complexity and user trust [27,31]. This paradigm shift is driven by the understanding that generic LLM outputs often "miss the domain-specific knowledge" [11,17,30,33] and that diverse stakeholders possess varied needs and levels of technical expertise [2,15,17,30,32,34]. Consequently, a primary future direction is to improve the comprehensibility of explanations, moving beyond technical intricacies to cater to a broader, non-technical audience [8,13,17,22,24,30,32].

A significant challenge identified is that current explanations can be "too complex for non-technical stakeholders" [24] and may even have "low simulation precision," potentially misleading users into forming incorrect mental models [30]. To address this, the field is advocating for **domain-adaptive explainability frameworks**. These frameworks integrate external, domain-specific knowledge—such as through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or knowledge graphs—to produce highly relevant and meaningful explanations for experts in fields like medicine or law [11,17,30]. For instance, systems like DocOA demonstrate the capability to provide "clinical evidence" to professionals for evaluating the rationale and accuracy of responses, effectively bridging the knowledge gap between machine learning developers and clinicians [19,20]. Similarly, for time series analysis, there is a clear call for a "comprehensible" model that prioritizes human understanding and interpretation [35]. The ongoing necessity for a "human in the loop" to verify LLM-generated evaluations, particularly in domain-specific contexts, further underscores the importance of human judgment and accessible explanations [29].

Furthermore, the concept of **persona-based XAI** is gaining traction, where explanations are dynamically tailored to the user's role (e.g., developer, end-user, regulator), expertise, background knowledge, and even neurodiversity needs [6,15,19,28,32]. This ensures that explanations are not only accurate but also actionable and understandable for their intended audience [2,9]. For example, DocOA tailors its outputs based on the user's role (patient or medical professional) and incorporates human evaluations, including "patient evaluation" to assess "user intent fulfillment and helpfulness" [20]. This is a critical departure from one-size-fits-all solutions, acknowledging the subjective differences in evaluation criteria even among human experts [21]. The development of "Thought Anchors," which categorize LLM reasoning into human-understandable abstractions like Plan Generation and Uncertainty Management, exemplifies a move towards human-centered control, allowing for more intuitive interaction and guidance of AI reasoning processes [3]. NeuroBreak, developed with AI security experts, has been praised for its "minimal learning costs and cognitive load" and "clear visual encoding," indicating the practical benefits of such human-centered design [18].

This paradigm shift also entails an evolution from static visualization toward explanation as an adaptive, trustworthy dialogue embedded in sociotechnical systems [2,15]. This vision promotes interactive systems where users can ask follow-up questions, refine explanations, and engage in "more natural interaction" [8,11,17,32]. Such systems inherently support context-awareness, reflecting "domain-specific constraints" and "institutional expectations" [15]. The emphasis on "user-centric XAI design," involving participatory design and user feedback loops, is crucial for aligning explanations with end-user needs and enhancing usability, thereby strengthening trust and engagement with AI systems [4,31].

Future development trajectories demand multidisciplinary wisdom [11,14,31], integrating human factors and cognitive science to create tailored explanation strategies that account for diverse user perceptions [31]. This includes addressing the "community participation difference problem" in open-source research and balancing the research focus between LLM internal mechanisms and performance enhancement to foster holistic and accessible XAI development [24]. The ultimate goal is to design explanations that are "cognitively accessible when needed, operationally actionable when demanded, and causally faithful when scrutiny requires it" [15], supporting appropriate human understanding across all stakeholders.
### 8.6 Efficient and Scalable Explainability for Resource-Intensive LLMs
The inherent scale and architectural complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by billions of parameters and extensive training data, fundamentally contribute to their "black box" nature and present significant challenges for developing efficient and scalable explainability methods [25,27]. The operation of these models is inherently "very expensive" due to their massive parameter counts and training on "trillions of tokens," making the integration of explainability (XAI) processes exceptionally resource-intensive [8,33]. This necessitates the development of computationally lightweight and scalable XAI methods specifically designed for billion-parameter models, a critical need highlighted across the literature [14,31].

A primary challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with generating explanations for LLMs. Traditional feature attribution techniques, such as gradient-based methods and SHAP values, demand "substantial computational power" when applied to models with billions of parameters, rendering them "less practical for real-world applications" [30]. This computational burden also translates into a significant environmental impact; for instance, training and tuning a single natural language processing model can exceed the lifetime CO2 emissions of an average person, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable and lower-carbon LLM architectures and, by extension, their explainability mechanisms [28]. The high computational cost creates a fundamental trade-off between the depth and quality of explanations and the feasibility of generating them in a timely and resource-efficient manner [15,30]. This tension is evident in scenarios where "deep causal traces can be valuable for audits, but may slow down moderation systems in real-time applications" due to their computational cost and latency [15].

Addressing these challenges requires innovative strategies. One promising direction involves developing "lightweight explanation mechanisms" and "optimizing computation processes" through techniques like "incremental and streaming explanations" to reduce latency and improve efficiency [32]. For instance, the "思维锚点解锁llm推理的关键句" paper suggests that sentence-level abstraction, by focusing on meaningful units rather than individual tokens, could pave the way for more scalable interpretability approaches, and identifying "Receiver Heads" might enable more efficient white-box analysis by targeting specific internal structures [3]. Similarly, the SoS-ML framework, while offering flexibility through its modular, multi-agent design, acknowledges that this very architecture could lead to significant computational costs due to multi-agent interactions, necessitating research into efficient algorithms and architectural optimizations for managing overhead and dynamic resource allocation [17]. NeuroBreak further illustrates an efficient strategy by employing a visual analytics approach for multi-granular analysis and highly efficient targeted safety fine-tuning that updates less than 0.2% of total parameters, achieving robust security comparable to full fine-tuning with minimal computational cost [18].

Another critical area of research explores "explainability-aware compression" or "interpretable distillation" to create smaller, explainable proxy models that retain key insights from the larger, opaque models. The Aug-imodels framework, particularly Aug-Linear, exemplifies this by achieving a "speed/memory improvement of greater than 1000x for inference compared to LLMs" and a "1000x reduction in model size" [16]. This significantly reduces "unnecessary energy/compute usage" and enables deployment in "low-compute settings (e.g., edge devices)" while demonstrating graceful performance degradation under model compression [16]. The concept of "attention redundancy" has also been identified as a potential avenue for developing model compression techniques that could lead to more efficient and scalable explainability [30].

Furthermore, strategies for cost-effective and scalable LLM deployment indirectly support explainability efforts. DocOA demonstrates a cost-effective method for enhancing LLMs in specialized domains by leveraging techniques like RAG and instruction-based prompts on "already-trained LLMs, such as GPT-4," thus avoiding the prohibitively high cost of training new models from scratch [20]. Similarly, the use of LLM-based evaluators offers significant cost and speed advantages over manual human evaluation, providing a scalable alternative for assessment needs, though the computational resources required for extensive LLM evaluation still warrant optimization [21,29]. While systemic optimizations for LLM training and serving—such as parallel computing, GPU memory optimization, communication optimization, and serving optimization—are primarily geared towards overall system efficiency, they lay the groundwork for more scalable XAI by making the underlying models more manageable [23]. However, the challenge remains to specifically integrate these efficiencies into the explainability generation pipeline.

In conclusion, the path towards efficient and scalable explainability for resource-intensive LLMs necessitates a multi-faceted approach. This includes developing lightweight explanation mechanisms, leveraging LLM modularity, exploring techniques like explainability-aware compression and interpretable distillation, and adopting cost-effective deployment and evaluation strategies. Future research must continue to balance the critical trade-offs between interpretability, performance, and computational cost, striving for solutions that are both insightful and deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments [17,31].
### 8.7 Bridging Faithfulness and Plausibility: The "Exoplanations" Challenge
The increasing sophistication of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their deployment in critical domains, necessitating a robust understanding of their decision-making processes. However, a central challenge in LLM explainability is the potential disconnect between the plausible-sounding explanations generated by these models and the actual mechanical steps or internal reasoning they employ. This crucial problem, termed "exoplanations" by Sarkar, highlights that LLM-generated narratives are often exogenous, serving to promote critical thinking rather than faithfully reflecting the model's true internal workings [7]. This subsection delves into the "exoplanations" challenge, examining its manifestations, implications, proposed solutions, and offering actionable guidance for future research and development.

The core of the "exoplanations" challenge lies in the observed mismatch between an LLM's generated "explanation" (its plausibility) and the underlying mechanical process of its prediction (its faithfulness) [7,15]. Multiple studies corroborate this inherent tension. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations, despite their intuitive appeal and ability to improve performance, are frequently reported as systematically unfaithful representations of the model's actual reasoning [12,30]. For instance, some LLMs, despite producing plausible CoT, may refuse to follow deliberately erroneous reasoning paths, indicating a lack of true internal fidelity to the generated steps [8]. Similarly, the "hallucination" problem, where LLMs generate plausible but factually incorrect or inappropriate assertions, directly aligns with the "exoplanations" concept, as models prioritize grammatical correctness and perceived plausibility over accuracy [28,34]. This phenomenon is not limited to CoT; even Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, designed for source attribution and faithfulness, can exhibit limitations where semantic similarity might not retrieve the most appropriate or complete information, leading to plausible but ultimately incorrect answers [20]. The foundational issue is that LLMs are "trained to produce answers that are perceived as correct by human editors" rather than strictly adhering to factual or mechanistic reality [28].

The implications of unfaithful plausible explanations are profound and potentially harmful. Misinterpreting these "exoplanations" can lead to "false trust" in models and the formation of incorrect mental models about their capabilities, especially when current XAI approaches are "insufficiently strong" or "misleading" [30,31]. Such misinterpretations can result in significant harms, particularly in complex, high-stakes scenarios [8,17]. The inherent opacity of LLMs further complicates verification, making it challenging to move beyond superficial explanations to those that genuinely contribute to appropriate human understanding [2].

Addressing the "exoplanations" challenge necessitates a shift from solely post-hoc explanations to intrinsically interpretable designs and robust verification mechanisms. The **System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML)** framework proposes a solution by moving away from post-hoc methods (criticized for often failing to "accurately reflect the internal workings of the models" and being "incomplete or misleading") towards "Evidence-Based Explanations by Design" [17]. SoS-ML integrates functional interpretability and contextual alignment to ensure explanations are inherently faithful to the model's architecture and decision processes. Similarly, approaches like Aug-imodels explicitly argue against "unfaithful" post-hoc explanations by designing intrinsically interpretable models where explanations *are* the true mechanical processes, thereby inherently bridging the faithfulness-plausibility gap [16]. Beyond intrinsic design, methods for causal validation and verification are crucial. NeuroBreak, for example, offers "mechanistic insights" by allowing users to test the causal impact of specific neurons, providing a powerful means to verify if an explanation is a faithful reflection of internal processes [18]. The "Thought Anchors" concept employs a "triangular validation" approach (black-box, white-box, and causal methods) to demonstrate the faithfulness of identified anchors to the model's actual decision-making mechanisms, suggesting that strong correlations across diverse attribution methods can indicate a faithful representation [3]. These advancements highlight that future research must focus on improving "explanation accuracy" and "explanation reliability" to mitigate misinterpretations [32].

A salient example of the "exoplanations" challenge arises when LLMs are employed as evaluators. While LLM-based evaluators can generate plausible textual "explanations" for their ratings, these narratives are often influenced by biases such as positional bias, verbosity, and self-enhancement, along with "limited mathematical and reasoning capabilities" [29]. This means the generated explanations might not faithfully represent the LLM's true internal decision process. For instance, in an empirical study of LLMs as human evaluation alternatives, ChatGPT provided seemingly reasonable explanations for ratings, but a human expert's disagreement on the definition of "grammaticality" (e.g., regarding punctuation errors) exposed a gap between the LLM's internal logic and nuanced human criteria [21]. This scenario vividly illustrates that LLM-generated evaluations and their accompanying explanations can be highly plausible yet fail to align with the faithful application of human-centric nuances or objective reasoning, exemplifying the core problem of "exoplanations" [7,21].

To navigate the pervasive "exoplanations" challenge, actionable guidance for researchers and developers centers on implementing robust "guardrails and responses" when LLMs generate explanations [7,15]. First, it is imperative to acknowledge that LLM-generated explanations are often "exogenous narratives" designed to promote critical thinking rather than being "true reflections of mechanical processes" [7]. Users, particularly in high-stakes applications like scientific coding, must be explicitly cautioned to be "extremely sceptical" and verify LLM outputs rigorously, as plausible but unfaithful responses can lead to errors and misinterpretations [28]. Second, future work needs to establish clear guardrails and design principles to ensure that LLM-generated evaluations and explanations are interpreted with an acute awareness of their inherent influences and limitations, rather than being misconstrued as neutral, objective reasoning [7,21]. This involves developing methods to probe and understand the *fidelity* of the LLM's high-level strategic decisions, moving beyond merely assessing the faithfulness of downstream models or post-hoc justifications [19]. Ultimately, the goal is to develop explanation techniques that bridge the gap between perceived fidelity and perceived interpretability, ensuring that LLM explanations are not only accurate but also genuinely understandable and reflective of the model's underlying processes [4]. This requires a concerted effort to balance "causal correctness and communicative clarity" in LLM explainability [15].
### 8.8 Interdisciplinary Approaches and Novel Frameworks
Advancements in Explainable AI (XAI) for Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly emphasize the critical necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration to foster more contextually relevant, human-aligned, and robust explanations [14,31]. This imperative extends beyond the traditional confines of computer science, drawing vital insights from fields such as philosophy, cognitive science, and social sciences [2,6,14,17]. Such collaborations are deemed essential for achieving "holistic solutions" that address the multifaceted nature of explainability, integrating technical aspects with ethical, user-centered, and broader societal perspectives [11,31].

Concrete instances of this interdisciplinary imperative are evident across diverse domains. In healthcare, the development of specialized medical LLMs, such as those for osteoarthritis management, necessitates close cooperation between physicians and data scientists, combining expertise in computer science, prompt engineering, and medical knowledge to construct evaluation benchmarks [20]. Similarly, the application of LLM-driven AutoML in clinical research, exemplified by ChatGPT-ADA, bridges data science and clinical medicine, with calls for further integration of medical ethics, legal frameworks (for data privacy and accountability), and cognitive science to optimize clinical interpretation of LLM outputs [19]. Beyond medicine, the application of LLMs to coding in ecology and evolution tacitly acknowledges the importance of human critical thinking and pedagogical benefits, highlighting the need for broader scientific communities to engage with the responsible use of LLMs [28]. The NeuroBreak system further demonstrates an interdisciplinary approach by integrating machine learning explainability with visual analytics, involving AI security experts and visualization specialists to tackle complex LLM security challenges [18]. Moreover, research in LLM transparency strongly advocates for interdisciplinary approaches, particularly at the intersection of AI and human-computer interaction (HCI), emphasizing human-centered design and understanding stakeholder needs [2,24]. The use of Aug-imodels in natural-language fMRI studies showcases the integration of advanced NLP with interpretable modeling, fostering novel insights in neuroscience by predicting brain voxel responses and generating scientific interpretations [16].

In response to the limitations of traditional post-hoc XAI and the growing complexity of LLMs, novel frameworks are emerging that embed interpretability directly into system design and align AI reasoning with human cognition. A prominent example is the **System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML)** framework, which fundamentally redefines "explanation" from a purely technical concern to a broader, socially-driven concept [17]. SoS-ML integrates insights from multiple disciplines: drawing on **philosophy** to conceptualize explanation; leveraging **cognitive science** to understand human information processing, inference, and preferences for contrastive and causal explanations; incorporating **social sciences** through linguistic theories (e.g., Chomsky's Innatist Theory, Vygotsky's Social Interactionist Theory) to inspire modular AI architectures, communication mechanisms (e.g., Language Acquisition Device, Zone of Proximal Development, scaffolding), and the perception of explanations as social constructs; and finally, drawing analogies from **neuroscience** (Regions of Interest) to propose "Functional XAI (fXAI)" where groups of components are inherently explainable [17]. This multi-faceted integration promotes collaboration among models to enhance AI's transparency and accountability, designing systems that are not only technically robust but also intrinsically aligned with human values and understanding [17].

Other novel frameworks also highlight diverse interdisciplinary integrations. The **TAXAL triadic framework** for explainable agentic LLMs combines cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning) dimensions, serving as a "generative tool for interdisciplinary dialogue" and emphasizing the incorporation of socio-political dimensions, regulatory contexts, and power asymmetries in XAI research [15]. This contrasts with SoS-ML by focusing on a triadic conceptualization of explanation rather than a system-of-systems architectural approach, yet shares the goal of sociotechnical integration. The **SAX4BPM framework** integrates LLMs with a "causal process execution view" within business process management, critically evaluating user perception, thereby combining AI, business process management, and human-computer interaction [4]. This approach underscores the value of domain-specific knowledge and user studies in enhancing LLM explainability. Furthermore, frameworks integrating LLMs with **knowledge graphs (KG-augmented LLM, LLM-augmented KG, synergistic LLM with KG)** represent another avenue for enhancing both performance and explainability by combining symbolic and neural approaches [24]. Similarly, DSR-LM, which combines differentiable symbolic reasoning with pre-trained LMs, improves logical reasoning capabilities [24]. These KG and DSR-LM approaches, while interdisciplinary in their fusion of different AI paradigms, primarily focus on architectural enhancements for reasoning and internal transparency, distinct from SoS-ML's broader emphasis on human-cognitive alignment and social construct of explanation, or TAXAL's sociotechnical integration.

The common thread across these interdisciplinary approaches and novel frameworks is a shared understanding that effective XAI for LLMs must move beyond purely technical post-hoc justifications towards human-centric, contextually aware, and inherently interpretable systems [2,6,31]. While SoS-ML offers a comprehensive blueprint rooted deeply in cognitive science, social sciences, and neuroscience for systemic interpretability [17], TAXAL extends this by explicitly addressing sociopolitical and ethical considerations [15]. Other frameworks focus on specific application domains or architectural integrations to improve reasoning and transparency. The future trajectory for XAI in LLMs points towards sustained, holistic interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration, requiring the development of methodologies that quantify human perception of explanations and embed ethical considerations directly into model design, ensuring AI systems are both powerful and inherently trustworthy [6,15]. This collective effort is crucial for advancing both LLM capabilities and XAI fields in unison [24].
### 8.9 Promising Research Avenues
The rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a continuous re-evaluation and expansion of Explainable AI (XAI) research to ensure transparency, trustworthiness, and responsible deployment. Future research avenues coalesce around several critical directions, aiming to bridge the complexity of LLMs with user trust [15,31]. These directions include refining existing XAI methods for enhanced faithfulness and interpretability, developing novel techniques tailored to LLMs' unique capabilities, establishing robust evaluation metrics, exploring advanced conceptual frameworks, and integrating explainability throughout the entire LLM lifecycle [14,25].

A primary research focus involves **refining existing XAI methods and fostering a deeper understanding of LLM internal mechanisms**. This requires developing explanation methods specifically tailored for diverse LLM architectures and applications, moving beyond generic approaches that may prove insufficient [30]. A crucial aspect is to deepen the understanding of LLMs' emergent capabilities, such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting, by investigating their origins within model structures and data influences [10,22,30]. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through techniques like Circuit Tracing, offers a highly promising pathway to dissect LLM internal components (e.g., MLPs, attention heads) and reveal the computational mechanisms underlying these emergent behaviors, thereby aiding in diagnosing issues like hallucinations and contributing to more reliable AI systems [12]. Researchers should also address shortcut learning and optimize attention mechanisms by mitigating attention redundancy, which can improve model generalization and efficiency [10,22,30]. Further investigation into the differences in reasoning paradigms between fine-tuning and prompting-based models is essential for a comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses [10,22,30]. Moreover, enhancing interpretable models, such as Aug-imodels, by extending their applicability beyond linear models and trees to rule lists, prototype-based models, and symbolic models, and improving interaction modeling through nonlinear transformations of embeddings or fitting long-range interaction terms, offers a way to leverage LLMs for augmenting interpretability in traditional models [16]. The continuous challenge of balancing interpretability with model performance necessitates the development of smarter, more accurate explanations that delve deeper into LLM internal mechanisms [11,15,24,32].

Establishing **advanced and robust evaluation methodologies** is paramount for progress in LLM explainability. This entails developing new and comprehensive evaluation metrics that can assess explanation quality against ground truth, measure context-specific performance, and ensure human comprehensibility [17,20,22,30,31,32]. Specific needs include formal mapping criteria with standardized scoring rubrics for cognitive, functional, and causal alignment [15]. A critical area for evaluation research also lies in developing methods to overcome LLMs' inherent hallucination and lack of inherent reasoning capacity when generating explanations, alongside addressing the observed trade-off between perceived fidelity and perceived interpretability [4,34]. For LLMs serving as evaluators, promising avenues include: developing standardized benchmarks across diverse NLP tasks; creating enhanced explainable LLM evaluators using novel prompting and architectural designs to ensure granular, consistent, and human-aligned justifications; focusing on bias detection and mitigation strategies (e.g., adversarial training, human-in-the-loop calibration); and exploring adaptive and personalized LLM evaluation frameworks that adjust criteria and explanation styles based on context and user needs [21,29].

The development of **novel techniques and adaptive explanation modalities** is essential as LLMs continue to evolve. This includes techniques tailored to multimodal inputs and long-context understanding [11,14,25,34]. Research should extend to adaptive explanation modalities, incorporating hybrid, emergent, and agentic XAI to support new paradigms and complex multi-agent systems, including mechanisms to trace dynamic intent, delegation, and inter-agent interactions [15]. Expanding the application of augmented interpretable models to tasks beyond classification/regression, such as sequence prediction or outlier detection, and to new domains like computer vision or protein engineering, showcases the potential for broader XAI impact [16]. Furthermore, the Thought Anchors framework can be extended to complex reasoning domains, potentially leading to "reasoning knobs" that allow humans to guide and influence an AI's reasoning process [3]. Future work should also explore new XAI paradigms that are more automated, user-centric, and integrate multidisciplinary wisdom, alongside adapting LLMs for time series analysis to achieve highly generalizable and comprehensible models [11,35].

Exploring **actionable XAI, causality, and falsifiability** represents a move towards more profound and impactful explanations. The field should shift towards actionable XAI, where insights directly lead to model improvements, enhanced reliability, and responsible application throughout the LLM lifecycle [14,30]. Investigating causality and the falsifiability of explanations is crucial to rigorously test claims of understanding and reasoning, moving beyond merely plausible narratives [14,17]. This also implies a fundamental shift from purely data-driven to explanation-driven AI, optimizing data utilization and model enhancement through XAI techniques, and redefining explainability goals to focus on specific, practical objectives rather than broad "why" questions [8].

Finally, **integrating explainability for responsible LLM development and synergistic human-LLM collaboration** is critical. Explainability considerations must be integrated into every stage of LLM development and deployment, from initial design to real-world application, rather than being an afterthought [17,24]. This includes directly addressing core LLM challenges such as trust, misinformation, ethics, privacy, and hallucination [10,19,22,24,34]. Developing human-centered approaches to transparency, accounting for diverse stakeholder needs and regulatory contexts, is vital for building governance-aware XAI ecosystems [2,6,15]. Proactive safety and ethics, including auditing potential risks and ensuring alignment with human values, are paramount for safe and ethical LLM deployment [28,30]. Practical solutions include advocating for the synergistic use of human and LLM evaluation, especially in early NLP system development [21]. This includes developing shared datasets with human-annotated explanations, creating open-source evaluation harnesses, and establishing community-driven working groups for metric definition [18,20]. Fostering open-source engagement and interdisciplinary collaborations, integrating principles from cognitive science and social sciences, will refine functional interpretability and enhance the ability to generate context-aware, evidence-based, and human-aligned explanations [17,24]. Ultimately, human-AI collaboration where humans maintain critical thinking skills to interpret LLM outputs, alongside exploring human-guided AI reasoning through concepts like "reasoning knobs," will be crucial for effective and responsible AI integration [3,28]. Strengthening privacy protection, security, and energy sustainability are also integral system-level advancements for responsible foundation model deployment [23].
## 9. Conclusion
The burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated an evolving understanding of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), moving beyond conventional transparency concerns to address the unique complexities and profound societal impact of these powerful models [10,24,30]. This survey has underscored that explainability is not merely an auxiliary feature but a critical foundation for fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling the ethical and safe deployment of LLMs across diverse domains [10,15,31].



A significant theme emerging from this review is the multi-faceted relationship between LLMs and explainability, encompassing their internal explainability, their utility as tools for XAI, and the unique challenges and opportunities arising when LLMs act as evaluators. Regarding **LLMs' internal explainability**, the inherent opacity and "black-box" nature of these models present formidable challenges, ranging from high model complexity and data dependency leading to biases, to output uncertainty and hallucinations [10,24,27]. Researchers are categorizing explanation methods based on training paradigms (fine-tuning versus prompting) and scope (local versus global explanations) to systematically tackle this complexity [1,13,27,30]. For instance, the concept of "Thought Anchors" has been introduced to identify pivotal sentences in Chain-of-Thought reasoning that disproportionately impact the final answer, revealing that high-level organizational sentences are stronger anchors than computational details [3]. Similarly, mechanistic interpretability, exemplified by techniques like Circuit Tracing, delves into the specific neural pathways responsible for various LLM functionalities, distinguishing between merely plausible explanations (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and truly faithful reflections of the model's internal reasoning [7,12]. This distinction is critical, as LLM-generated "explanations" often function as "exoplanations," valuable for critical thinking but not necessarily for genuine model understanding [7]. Tools like NeuroBreak further aid in systematically exploring and understanding internal security mechanisms by tracing and comparing neuron behaviors across layers and samples, identifying vulnerable pathways and neuron cooperation patterns under adversarial conditions [18]. While a hypothetical "InterpretableLLM" framework speculatively suggests potential for significant improvements in explanation accuracy (from approximately 70% to 90%) and user satisfaction (scores exceeding 4.5/5), actual empirical validation of such broad claims remains an active research area [32].

Conversely, **LLMs are increasingly leveraged as powerful tools *for* XAI**, bridging the gap between intricate AI systems and human understanding through natural language [11]. This includes promoting "Usable XAI" by enhancing XAI frameworks through LLMs themselves, and vice-versa [8]. For example, LLMs can generate Situation-Aware eXplainability (SAX) in AI-augmented Business Process Management Systems (ABPMSs) by synthesizing causal process execution views into human-interpretable explanations [4]. The integration of LLMs with interpretable models, forming "Aug-imodels," has demonstrated substantial efficiency gains (e.g., >1000x inference speed/memory improvement) while maintaining complete transparency, facilitating deployment in high-stakes, compute-limited environments [16]. In clinical research, tools like ChatGPT ADA offer explainability insights via SHAP analysis and natural language reasoning, accelerating automated machine learning in medical studies [19]. Similarly, specialized LLMs like DocOA utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide source attribution, significantly improving domain-specific performance and explainability in contexts like osteoarthritis management [20]. These applications highlight LLMs' capacity to generate richer, more contextual, and often more accessible explanations than traditional XAI methods.

The role of **LLMs as evaluators** introduces a unique set of explainability challenges and opportunities. Empirical studies have validated LLM evaluation as a viable alternative to human assessment for text quality in various NLP tasks, showcasing advantages such as enhanced reproducibility and significant cost/time savings [21]. However, this approach is not without limitations, including LLMs' potential for factual errors, behavioral biases, lack of emotional understanding, and inability to process visual cues [21]. The nuanced findings from user studies indicate that while "guard-railing" LLM inputs can lead to "better-perceived fidelity," it often comes "at the cost of the perceived interpretability," moderated by user perception of "trust and curiosity" [4]. This emphasizes the fundamental trade-off between perceived explanation quality attributes and highlights the necessity of a hybrid approach, where LLM evaluation complements human expertise rather than fully replacing it, particularly in high-stakes domains like academic peer review or medical diagnosis [9,20,21]. The broader challenge of evaluating LLM-generated content underscores the insufficiency of current metrics, which often suffer from computational costs, poor correlation with human judgment, inherent biases, and limitations in assessing complex qualities like code maintainability [10,24,29].

The overarching goal is to achieve responsible and trustworthy AI, a vision strongly advocated by various works [15,31]. This necessitates a shift towards a Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) paradigm, where the human context and the "who" behind the interpretation of explanations are paramount, moving beyond mere algorithmic transparency [2,6]. Frameworks like TAXAL, which integrates cognitive clarity, functional utility, and causal faithfulness, are critical for developing explanation strategies that meet diverse stakeholder needs in high-risk sociotechnical domains [15]. Similarly, System-of-Systems Machine Learning (SoS-ML) integrates insights from social and cognitive sciences to embed explainability directly into AI system design, fostering human-like reasoning and context-awareness, and enhancing model accuracy and interpretability [17]. These approaches collectively contribute to making AI systems transparent, participatory, and ethically aligned [15].

As LLMs continue to advance, the future of XAI for LLMs demands addressing several open questions and pursuing a clear research roadmap [2]. Key directions include developing tailored explanation methods, enhancing evaluation fidelity, and improving human interpretability [30]. Bridging the faithfulness-plausibility gap, establishing "correct" explanation standards, uncovering the roots of emergent phenomena, and dissecting the differences between training paradigms are crucial steps [8,10]. Furthermore, addressing issues such as bias mitigation, privacy protection, and the environmental impact of LLMs is paramount for ensuring sustainable and ethical AI development [23,28,34].

In conclusion, the journey toward fully explainable LLMs requires a concerted, interdisciplinary research effort from the community [14,24,31]. This effort must focus on developing innovative methods for robust evaluation, effective bias mitigation, and the generation of human-aligned explanations across all facets of LLM explainability [10,21,24]. By continuously refining our understanding and methodologies, we can ensure that LLMs are not only powerful but also transparent, accountable, and ultimately beneficial for society.
