# A Survey on Safety in Large Language Models

# 0. A Survey on Safety in Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a profound transformation in the field of Artificial Intelligence, propelling capabilities in natural language processing and generation to unprecedented levels. Models like ChatGPT demonstrate astonishing performance and have seen rapid integration across diverse sectors, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, and medical diagnostics [6,21,28]. This pervasive adoption underscores their immense potential to drive innovation and societal benefit.

However, the immense power and widespread deployment of LLMs are juxtaposed with significant inherent risks, necessitating a compelling and urgent focus on robust safety research. Neglecting these potential harms can lead to severe ethical, legal, and financial repercussions, making responsible development and deployment a critical priority for technology stakeholders [7,20]. The challenges of AI safety are not entirely novel; issues like bias in machine learning and natural language processing systems have a historical context, predating LLMs [17]. LLMs, trained on vast internet data, inherit and often amplify these existing biases, toxic content, and security vulnerabilities, thereby necessitating continuous vigilance and advanced mitigation strategies [20,29]. Prominent concerns include the generation of false yet fluent information (hallucinations), the perpetuation of societal biases and toxic content, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaking [4,5,18,20,21,27].

Against this backdrop, "LLM safety" emerges as a comprehensive and multi-faceted domain, distinct from general AI safety, aimed at ensuring the responsible, secure, and ethical operation of these advanced models [7]. The overarching goal is to prevent unintended consequences, maintain public trust, and align AI systems with human values to minimize harm [7,21]. Central to this endeavor are the concepts of trustworthiness, which encompasses factual accuracy, transparency, and ethical conduct, and alignment, ensuring that LLM behaviors conform to human values and societal expectations rather than just statistical patterns [21,22,28].

To provide a structured understanding, LLM safety can be broadly categorized into several core dimensions:
1.  **Security:** Addressing the models' resilience against malicious attempts such as adversarial attacks, jailbreaking, data poisoning, and prompt injection, alongside protection against personally identifiable information (PII) leakage [14,21,25].
2.  **Ethics:** Focusing on preventing the generation of harmful, discriminatory, or unethical content, encompassing biases (explicit and implicit) and toxicity (offensive or hateful content) [17,28].
3.  **Reliability:** Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of LLM outputs, primarily tackling issues like hallucinations, misinformation harm, and challenges related to information completeness and consistency [16,21]. Hallucinations, in particular, manifest in various forms, including input-conflicting, context-conflicting, fact-conflicting, linguistic, and even multimodal inconsistencies, posing significant challenges to model trustworthiness [3,22,27].
4.  **Human-centric Aspects:** Concerned with the broader impacts of LLM interaction on humans, such as over-reliance on potentially flawed outputs, which can lead to misinformation, communication errors, and automation bias [2].

This survey adopts a "Systemic Safety Engineering for Large Models" or a "Holistic Lifecycle Approach to Large Model Safety." It systematically traces safety considerations across the entire lifecycle, from data curation and model development to deployment and continuous monitoring, incorporating insights from LLMOps and guardrail mechanisms [5,27,28]. Our comprehensive analysis extends beyond LLMs to include Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents, detailing attack and defense methods specific to each [21]. By synthesizing diverse research perspectives—ranging from generative harms like bias, toxicity, and hallucinations to security vulnerabilities such as prompt injection and OWASP Top 10 threats, along with privacy concerns and value misalignment—this survey aims to provide a unified understanding of the complex landscape of large model safety [2,6,14,26,29]. Ultimately, this work seeks to offer a critical domain analysis framework that addresses the technical, ethical, and governance aspects of large model safety, thereby guiding future research and development towards more secure, robust, and ethically aligned AI systems [21,31].
### 1.1 Background and Motivation
The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, and medical diagnostics, have profoundly transformed the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) [6,21,28]. Models like ChatGPT demonstrate astonishing performance in natural language processing, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generation across various modalities [6,21,22,26]. This proliferation, as evidenced by ChatGPT's rapid user acquisition, underscores their significant potential and integration into critical applications [4,28].

However, this immense power is juxtaposed with inherent risks and significant responsibilities, giving rise to a compelling need for robust LLM safety research [7,21]. Neglecting these risks can lead to severe ethical, legal, and financial consequences, emphasizing the accountability of technology pioneers to prioritize LLM safety [7,12,20]. The inherent dual nature of these models positions them as both powerful tools for societal benefit and potential sources of significant harm [7,21]. Therefore, integrating principles of robustness, reliability, and ethical considerations throughout the entire Large Model lifecycle is not merely desirable but critically urgent [28]. This involves establishing LLM guardrails that are proactive and prescriptive, designed to manage sensitive user data, prevent harmful outputs, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards, thus maintaining trust in real-time systems [5].

The challenges of AI safety are not entirely novel to the era of LLMs. Biases in machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have a historical and societal context, predating the advent of LLMs and forming a continuity of these ethical challenges [17]. Automated decision systems, even before LLMs, have demonstrated the capacity to exhibit biases, leading to unfair outcomes that disproportionately affect certain groups, as seen in racial biases in healthcare algorithms or gender bias in hiring systems [17]. NLP, in particular, has long grappled with pervasive biases stemming from cognitive biases in textual data, manifesting as explicit discrimination or implicit prejudices through unintentional language choices [17]. This historical perspective highlights that LLMs, being trained on vast internet data, inherit and often amplify these existing biases and toxic content, necessitating continued research and vigilance [18,20,29].

The multi-faceted nature of Large Model safety becomes apparent when comparing and contrasting the priority and perceived severity of different risks. Hallucination, where LLMs generate false yet fluent information, is frequently highlighted as a critical safety concern that threatens software quality and user trust, especially in mission-critical applications [4,9,13,19,27]. It is seen as a significant challenge requiring practical approaches for spotting, measuring, and reducing problematic outputs to rebuild user confidence [3,4].

Concurrently, bias and toxicity are widely recognized as fundamental risks. LLMs inherently possess a propensity to generate offensive, hateful, or biased content due to learning from diverse internet data, posing a significant risk to users and perpetuating societal prejudices [6,8,18,20,28]. The challenge lies in detoxifying LLMs while preserving their original generation capabilities, underscoring the severity of this issue [10,18].

Beyond these, adversarial attacks, such as prompt injection and jailbreaking, represent another critical security dimension, exposing models to malicious manipulation and data leakage [2,5,14,21,25]. The increasing power and autonomy of LLMs also make them attractive targets for malicious actors, necessitating robust safeguards [7,23]. Other concerns include private data leaks, misinformation harm, and broader ethical, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts [6,12,15,22]. While specific papers might foreground certain risks (e.g., hallucination mitigation being a primary focus for some [9,19]), the collective research points to a comprehensive understanding of 'safety' that encompasses these diverse challenges without explicitly debating their foundational understanding but rather emphasizing their interconnectedness and cumulative impact.

In conclusion, the compelling need for Large Model safety arises from their pervasive integration and transformative power across all sectors, coupled with their inherent capacity to cause significant harm through various vectors, including biases, hallucinations, security vulnerabilities, and ethical pitfalls [7,21]. This dual nature necessitates a critical, proactive focus on safety to ensure these powerful AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, fostering trust and maximizing societal benefit while mitigating potential risks [12,31,32].
### 1.2 Defining LLM Safety: Core Concepts and Dimensions
Large Language Model (LLM) safety represents a comprehensive and multi-faceted domain, distinct from general AI safety, focused on ensuring the responsible and secure operation of these advanced models [7]. It encompasses a broad spectrum of concerns, including robustness against attacks, ethical behavior, reliability, and user well-being [7,21]. Several works define LLM safety through its inherent challenges, such as vulnerabilities to adversarial, jailbreak, and backdoor attacks, potential data privacy breaches, and the generation of harmful or misleading content, all of which threaten system integrity, confidentiality, and availability [21,26]. The overarching goal of LLM safety is to prevent unintended consequences, maintain public trust, and promote responsible AI usage, ensuring that AI systems function as intended and align with ethical standards to minimize harm [7,21].

Central to LLM safety are the concepts of trustworthiness and alignment. Trustworthiness in LLMs is intrinsically linked to factual accuracy, transparency, and ethical conduct [16,28]. The principle of 'honesty' is particularly crucial for aligning LLMs with human values, demanding that models acknowledge their knowledge boundaries and faithfully present known information [22]. This alignment aims to bridge the gap between the statistical patterns learned during pre-training and human societal expectations, thereby preventing models from generating toxic content, spreading misinformation, or perpetuating biases [21,30]. Value misalignment emerges as a critical safety issue, denoting instances where LLM behavior deviates from intended human values or ethical principles, extending beyond mere harmful content generation to encompass broader societal impacts [21,26]. Techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and frameworks like Anthropic's "Constitutional AI" are highlighted as mechanisms to enhance accuracy and ensure ethical, responsible behavior, reinforcing value alignment [28].

LLM safety can be categorized into several key pillars to provide a structured understanding of its core dimensions:

1.  **Security (against attacks)**: This pillar addresses the models' resilience to malicious attempts to subvert their intended function. Specific concerns include adversarial attacks, jailbreaking (exploiting biases to bypass content policies), data poisoning, prompt injection, and the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) from training data or user interactions [5,14,21,25,29]. Red teaming efforts are dedicated to identifying and mitigating such vulnerabilities to ensure secure operation [23].

2.  **Ethics (bias, toxicity)**: This dimension focuses on preventing LLMs from generating harmful, discriminatory, or unethical content. 'Bias' is defined as a preference or prejudice for or against a specific entity, often unfairly, encompassing explicit and implicit forms, which can lead to discriminatory outputs [17,28,29]. 'Toxicity' refers to content that is offensive, hateful, rude, vulgar, or incites harm, an inherent property often stemming from LLMs' training on unfiltered internet data [18,29]. Ensuring inclusivity, diversity, and equity throughout the LLM lifecycle is crucial to mitigate these ethical risks [28].

3.  **Reliability (hallucination, factuality)**: This pillar addresses the accuracy and consistency of LLM outputs. It primarily tackles issues like 'hallucinations,' 'misinformation harm,' and challenges with information completeness and consistency [6,16,21].

4.  **Human-centric aspects (over-reliance, agency)**: This category encompasses risks related to how humans interact with and are affected by LLMs. A significant concern is 'over-reliance,' where users or systems unduly trust LLM-generated content, even when it is false, incorrect, or inappropriate, without adequate supervision or confirmation [2]. This can lead to misinformation, communication errors, and broader societal impacts such as automation bias and threats to academic integrity [2,16].



![Types of LLM Hallucinations](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/p5mXdVyK1vvco6BOomqeA_Types%20of%20LLM%20Hallucinations.png)

Among the reliability concerns, 'hallucination' is a critical and extensively studied safety issue. Hallucinations are characterized by LLMs generating false, incorrect, nonsensical, or fabricated information as fact, often appearing plausible but lacking factual grounding or consistency [4,11,22,27]. Several papers provide detailed categorizations of hallucination:

*   **Input-conflicting hallucination** refers to content generated by LLMs that deviates from the source input provided by users, commonly observed in tasks like summarization or machine translation [27].
*   **Context-conflicting hallucination** occurs when the LLM generates content that contradicts information it previously generated, often indicating deficiencies in state tracking or long-range memory [27].
*   **Fact-conflicting hallucination** describes instances where LLMs produce content that is inconsistent with established world knowledge or common sense, resulting in factual errors [27]. This also includes 'factual' hallucinations, where explicit statements are incorrect (e.g., historical dates), and 'temporal' hallucinations, where outdated knowledge is presented as current [3].
*   **Linguistic hallucination** involves grammatically correct but semantically incoherent sentences [3].
*   **Extrinsic hallucination** refers to content unsupported by source documents, particularly relevant in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [3].
*   **Intrinsic hallucination** is characterized by contradictory or self-conflicting answers within the model's own output [3].
*   Specialized forms include **medical hallucinations**, where models may present accurate but irrelevant information or misinterpret medical contexts, and **code generation hallucinations**, which involve erroneous content when handling complex programming scenarios [4,22]. Furthermore, **multimodal hallucinations** describe content inconsistent with visual inputs in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), underscoring the challenge across different modalities [22]. The phenomenon of 'fawning hallucinations', where models generate excessively positive or flattering but false information, has also been identified as a specific concern [13].

The challenge of hallucinations is compounded by their plausible appearance, making detection difficult for both humans and other models, and the immense scale of training data which often includes fabricated, outdated, or biased information [27]. Addressing these diverse forms of hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability, trustworthiness, and overall safety of LLMs in practical applications [9,19].
### 1.3 Scope and Organization of the Survey
This survey is systematically structured to provide a comprehensive analysis of safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), logically progressing from the identification and definition of safety concerns to an in-depth examination of their origins, followed by a detailed discussion of mitigation strategies and evaluation methodologies. Informed by a comprehensive compilation of existing surveys on LLMs and their safety dimensions [1], our primary focus encompasses a broad spectrum of critical safety issues. These include generative harms such as bias, toxicity, misinformation, and hallucinations [9,20,22,27,29], along with security vulnerabilities, adversarial attack robustness, and privacy concerns. Specific security threats analyzed range from prompt injection, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking [14] to the broader OWASP Top 10 security threats, including training data poisoning, sensitive information disclosure, and model theft [2]. Furthermore, we address multimodal risks, value misalignment, misuse potential, and the safety implications of autonomous AI agents [23,26]. This broad coverage ensures a holistic perspective on the diverse challenges LLMs present, building upon risk categorizations identified by prominent research institutions [6].

The overarching perspective of this survey is framed as a 'Systemic Safety Engineering for Large Models' or a 'Holistic Lifecycle Approach to Large Model Safety.' This approach traces safety considerations across the entire lifecycle of large models, from initial data curation and model development through deployment and continuous monitoring. For instance, bias detection and mitigation are explored within the LLMOps lifecycle, emphasizing embedding Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity (ID&E) from data collection to deployment [28]. Mitigation strategies for issues like hallucination are similarly examined across different stages, including pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and inference [27]. The integration of guardrails is also considered a critical component for addressing vulnerabilities and ensuring safety during deployment [5,7]. This lifecycle perspective also considers how safety challenges manifest across data, model architecture, prompting techniques, alignment mechanisms, and scalability [32].

This survey distinguishes itself by synthesizing diverse perspectives and areas of focus from the existing literature, presenting a truly holistic overview that integrates various sub-fields of Large Model safety research. Unlike compilations that primarily list research articles without defining a specific argumentative flow [30], our work actively synthesizes findings. For example, while some surveys concentrate on LLM-specific risks and their causal mechanisms [6], others provide comprehensive reviews of security and privacy challenges encompassing training data, user vulnerabilities, and application-based risks [25]. This survey unifies these viewpoints, covering not only LLMs but also Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents, detailing attack and defense methods specific to each model category [21]. It further incorporates insights from extensive red teaming surveys that categorize risk taxonomies, attack strategies, evaluation metrics, and defensive approaches for generative models, including multimodal red teaming [23]. By integrating these varied contributions, including critical discussions on value misalignment, adversarial robustness, misuse, and autonomous AI risks, alongside interpretability and governance frameworks [26], this survey aims to offer a unified understanding of the complex landscape of large model safety.

Ultimately, our ambition is to provide a comprehensive and critical domain analysis framework that addresses the technical, ethical, and governance aspects of large model safety [21]. This includes reviewing mitigation methods, evaluation resources, and exploring themes such as technological roadmaps from AI companies, international cooperation, policy recommendations, and future regulatory directions [12,26,31]. By thoroughly dissecting current challenges and solutions, this survey seeks to guide future research and development towards more secure, robust, and ethically aligned large models.
## 2. Taxonomy of Large Model Safety Risks and Vulnerabilities
The rapid advancement and widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought forth unprecedented capabilities, yet simultaneously unveiled a complex and evolving landscape of safety risks and vulnerabilities. Ensuring the responsible development and deployment of these powerful AI systems necessitates a comprehensive understanding and systematic categorization of these challenges [21,26]. This section establishes a theoretical framework for classifying the multifaceted risks associated with LLMs, moving beyond superficial observations to provide a structured taxonomy that underpins effective analysis and mitigation strategies. This framework organizes risks based on their origin, nature, and impact, reflecting both intrinsic model behaviors and extrinsic interactions within complex ecosystems.



![Taxonomy of Large Model Safety Risks](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/t0s7ZzedsO5Xp3lo187bu_Taxonomy%20of%20Large%20Model%20Safety%20Risks.png)

Our taxonomy delineates six primary categories of LLM safety risks, each explored in subsequent sub-sections:

1.  **Generative Harms**: This category encompasses risks inherent to the LLM's core function of generating human-like text. It delves into how biases and problematic patterns from vast training datasets can lead to discriminatory outputs (bias), the generation of disrespectful or offensive content (toxicity), the creation and dissemination of false or misleading information (misinformation), the fabrication of facts or non-sensical content (hallucinations), and situations where model behavior deviates from human ethical standards (value misalignment) [6,20]. These harms are often rooted in the statistical learning process and the inherent nature of the training data.

2.  **Adversarial Attacks and Security Vulnerabilities**: This domain addresses intentional manipulations by malicious actors and inherent structural weaknesses that can compromise an LLM's integrity, confidentiality, and availability. It covers prompt-based attacks, such as prompt injection (overriding instructions), prompt leaking (extracting sensitive information), and jailbreaking (bypassing safeguards for harmful content generation) [2,14]. Additionally, it explores data-centric vulnerabilities like data poisoning (tampering training data), sensitive information disclosure (accidental or model-induced leakage), and broader supply chain risks stemming from contaminated data or flawed third-party components [21,22]. Memorization and privacy-related attacks, including data extraction and membership inference attacks, are also detailed, highlighting risks to sensitive data and intellectual property.

3.  **Human-Computer Interaction Risks and Misuse**: This category focuses on the dynamic interplay between users and LLMs. It examines the psychological phenomena, such as anthropomorphism and automation bias, that can lead users to over-rely on LLMs or misunderstand their capabilities [6,16]. Furthermore, it addresses technical vulnerabilities triggered by human interaction, including insecure output handling (where LLM outputs are processed unsafely by downstream systems) and the operational risks posed by malicious or excessive user interactions, such as denial-of-service attacks or the deliberate misuse of LLMs for illicit activities [23].

4.  **Socioeconomic and Environmental Risks**: This section broadens the scope to examine the systemic impacts of LLMs on society and the environment. Environmentally, it analyzes the significant energy consumption and water usage associated with LLM training and inference, alongside the emerging threat of Energy Latency Attacks (ELAs) [6,21]. Socioeconomically, it discusses the potential effects on labor markets (job displacement, inequality), human creativity (intellectual property, artistic originality), and educational systems (academic integrity, inequity of access) [16].

5.  **Multimodal Safety Risks**: With the integration of diverse data types such as text, images, and audio, new and more complex safety challenges emerge. This category explores issues like multimodal hallucination, where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs, and the expanded attack surface for adversarial attacks that leverage cross-modal vulnerabilities (e.g., multimodal pragmatic jailbreaks for text-to-image models) [22,27]. It also addresses the detection challenges posed by multimodal harmful content, like malicious memes, and the unique architectural vulnerabilities of multimodal systems [21].

6.  **Risks from Large Model Agents and Autonomous Systems**: This final category addresses the heightened risks when LLMs are endowed with agency and the ability to interact autonomously with the real world. These systems present unique challenges related to control, accountability, and predictability, including the potential for "excessive agency" leading to unintended actions and novel attack vectors in physical environments (e.g., LLM-controlled robots, autonomous driving systems) [2,26]. The implications of agents acting on false information (hallucination in agents) and the vulnerabilities across their operational stages are critical considerations [22,27].

This comprehensive taxonomy highlights that LLM safety is not merely a technical problem but a complex interdisciplinary challenge, demanding ongoing research into robust detection, mitigation, and ethical alignment strategies across the entire LLM lifecycle. The interconnectedness of these risk categories, where one vulnerability can exacerbate another, underscores the necessity for holistic approaches and continuous vigilance in navigating the evolving landscape of AI safety.
### 2.1 Generative Harms: Bias, Toxicity, Misinformation, Hallucinations, and Value Misalignment

**Generative Harms Summary**

| Harm Type         | Definition / Key Characteristics                                                                                                              | Primary Root Cause                                          | Impact / Consequences                                                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bias**          | Discriminatory outputs, stereotyping, unfair treatment based on race, gender, etc., amplifying real-world prejudices. Explicit & implicit forms. | Problematic patterns in vast, unfiltered training datasets. | Marginalization, unfair outcomes, "technological washing," erosion of trust.             |
| **Toxicity**      | Disrespectful, vulgar, offensive, or harm-inciting language (hate speech, insults, threats). Often context-dependent.                             | Inherent attribute learned from unfiltered internet data.   | Emotional distress, harassment, public safety threats, societal divisions, trust erosion. |
| **Misinformation**| False or misleading information disseminated. Hallucination is a significant source.                                                            | Biases in training data, model's generative process.        | Erosion of public trust, flawed decisions, reputational damage, severe consequences.     |
| **Hallucinations**| LLMs generating false, nonsensical, or fabricated information as fact, appearing plausible but lacking factual grounding or consistency.          | Model's generative process, limited contextual understanding, noisy training data. | Erosion of user trust, flawed decisions in high-stakes domains, difficult to detect.     |
| **Value Misalignment**| Model outputs or behaviors conflict with established human values or ethical frameworks. Includes "ethical drift" or "fake alignment."         | Gap between statistical patterns & human societal expectations, inadequate guidelines. | Undermines ethical standards, generates harmful content, spreads misinformation, trust erosion. |

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of generative harms in Large Language Models (LLMs), systematically categorizing them into bias, toxicity, misinformation, hallucinations, and value misalignment. These phenomena represent critical safety concerns due to their potential for widespread negative societal impact, erosion of trust, and propagation of harmful content [6,21]. The primary root cause underlying these harms is frequently attributed to the biases and problematic patterns inherent in the vast, often unfiltered, training datasets from which LLMs learn [20,28].

The discussion begins by characterizing **bias** and **toxicity**. Bias manifests as discriminatory outputs, stereotyping, and unfair treatment across various dimensions, including race, gender, and socio-economic status, often amplifying real-world prejudices or creating new ones through "technological washing" [6,29]. Toxicity encompasses disrespectful, vulgar, or harm-inciting language, such as hate speech, identity attacks, and threats [5,6]. A key insight is that toxicity is often an 'inherent attribute' learned during training, reflecting the "human good and bad" present in internet data [18,20]. This section will detail concrete examples of problematic outputs, discuss the various forms of explicit and implicit biases (including multi-category and domain-specific biases), and analyze novel methods used to circumvent toxicity detection mechanisms, such as embedding profanity in ASCII art [22]. The comparison of LLM-generated toxicity with broader societal biases highlights the complexity of mitigation, particularly with the nuanced and context-dependent nature of harmful language.

Next, the section differentiates **misinformation** from **hallucinations**, clarifying their distinct origins and impacts. Hallucination refers to LLMs generating false, nonsensical, or entirely fabricated information presented as fact, often stemming from the model's generative process and limited contextual understanding, or from noise in training data [4,11]. Misinformation, in a broader sense, includes any false or misleading information, with hallucination being a significant source originating from LLMs [6,31]. We will explore various types of hallucinations, including input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting, as well as their manifestation in specialized domains like medical diagnoses and code generation, and across multimodal contexts [22,27]. A critical challenge discussed is the difficulty in detecting and mitigating these issues, given that LLMs can produce highly plausible but incorrect information with misplaced certainty, and often lack mechanisms for grounding truthfulness or verifying facts [4,27].

Finally, the section addresses **value misalignment** and **ethical drift**, concepts central to ensuring LLMs behave in accordance with human ethical standards [21,26]. Value misalignment describes instances where model outputs or behaviors conflict with established human values or ethical frameworks, encompassing issues like generating toxic content, spreading misinformation, or perpetuating biases [7,29]. While "ethical drift" is often implicitly addressed, it refers to the evolution or deviation of LLM behavior from intended ethical principles over time, evident in issues like "fake alignment" where models superficially adhere to safety rules without genuine ethical understanding, or model degradation leading to increased harms [21,27]. The analysis will contrast formal corporate policies and ethical guidelines implemented by developers (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic's Constitutional AI) with observed model behaviors, highlighting where current guidelines may be insufficient, ambiguous, or easily circumvented by adversarial attacks like jailbreaking [28,29]. This systematic examination underscores the complex interplay between training data, model architecture, mitigation strategies, and the ongoing challenge of aligning LLM behavior with diverse and evolving human values.
#### 2.1.1 Bias and Toxicity
The pervasive issues of bias and toxicity represent fundamental safety challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs), stemming directly from their training on vast, often unfiltered, datasets that reflect the complexities of human communication, including both its positive and negative aspects [20,29]. This section systematically categorizes the various forms of harmful content generation and bias, outlines their root causes, and elucidates why these phenomena constitute a critical safety concern, providing concrete examples of problematic outputs generated by models.

The harmful outputs from LLMs can be broadly categorized into distinct typologies. **Bias** manifests as a preference or aversion towards specific groups, individuals, or concepts, leading to discriminatory outputs [29]. This includes explicit biases such as racial, gender, political, and socio-economic discrimination, often leading to stereotyping and unfair treatment [6,17]. For instance, LLMs have been shown to perpetuate racial biases in medical diagnoses, disproportionately associating certain diseases with minority male patients, and exhibiting gender stereotypes in career narratives, sometimes amplifying these biases beyond real-world statistics [20,29]. The concept of "technological washing" further exacerbates this, where the perceived objectivity of AI systems inadvertently entrenches these biases, making them permanent and difficult to dismantle [6]. Beyond explicit forms, **implicit textual biases** operate more subtly, reinforcing prejudices through unintentional language choices or inferring personal characteristics without consent [6,17]. Multi-category biases, which cut across several social dimensions, are also a significant area of research, with datasets like ANUBIS developed to evaluate them [22].

**Toxicity**, defined as disrespectful, vulgar, rude, or harm-inciting content, encompasses a wide spectrum of offensive language [29]. This includes hate speech, profane language, identity attacks, insults, threats, and incitement to violence [5,6]. Research demonstrates that LLMs can generate highly toxic text even from benign inputs, a finding underscored by datasets such as "Real Toxicity Prompts" [21]. The severity of toxic outputs can escalate significantly when models are "jailbroken" or subjected to direct toxic prompts, leading to content advocating illegal activities or self-harm [20,29].

The **root cause** of these issues primarily lies in the training data. LLMs learn and perpetuate biases and toxic patterns directly from the vast repositories of human-generated text on which they are trained [2,6,20,28]. This means toxicity is often an 'inherent attribute' learned during training, rather than an external phenomenon [18,20]. Models like LLaMA explicitly acknowledge that their training data contains "offensive, harmful and biased content," leading to the generation of undesirable outputs [8]. Data disparities, such as an overrepresentation of English content, also lead to performance differences and biases against less-resourced languages [6].

The generation of biased and toxic content by LLMs represents a **critical safety concern** due to its potential for widespread social harm. At an individual level, such outputs can cause emotional distress, harassment, and reinforce harmful stereotypes. On a broader societal scale, LLMs generating content that promotes extremism, disseminates misinformation, or facilitates illegal activities can lead to public safety threats, deepen societal divisions, and erode trust in AI systems [6,7,20]. The goal of safety alignment and guardrails is explicitly to prevent these harms [5].

A significant challenge in addressing these issues is the comparison between direct harmful content and **broader societal biases**, alongside **novel ways toxicity is disguised**. Implicit biases, for instance, are harder to detect than explicit discriminatory statements [17]. Moreover, adversaries develop sophisticated techniques to circumvent detection mechanisms; for example, embedding profanity within ASCII art to bypass traditional toxicity filters with high success rates [22]. Toxicity can also be subtly disguised through politically correct language or integrated into multimodal content like memes, necessitating advanced detection capabilities [22]. Within in-context learning, "copy bias" further exacerbates the problem by causing models to perpetuate observed patterns from examples rather than inferring underlying logical principles, thereby reinforcing existing biases without deep understanding [22].

Despite efforts by companies like Azure and Amazon to implement guardrails and content safety tools [3,5,28], the **persistence of bias and toxicity** in LLM outputs highlights potential gaps and ambiguities in current guidelines and their practical application. This indicates an ongoing **value misalignment** where observed model behaviors still deviate from desired ethical standards and corporate policies aimed at preventing harm [29]. The difficulty in precisely defining and consistently detecting context-dependent toxicity, coupled with the inherent learning of problematic patterns from training data, underscores the complexity of fully aligning LLM behavior with human values. This necessitates continuous research into more robust mitigation strategies, advanced detection techniques for both explicit and implicit harms, and a deeper understanding of how value systems can be more effectively embedded throughout the LLM lifecycle.
##### 2.1.1.1 Discrimination and Stereotyping
Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire and propagate discrimination and stereotyping primarily through their training data, which inherently reflects existing societal inequalities and biases [6,20]. This data, collected from unequal contexts, embeds and amplifies existing injustices, leading to discriminatory outputs that can marginalize vulnerable groups or promote harmful ideologies, such as hate speech containing insulting words and ideologically charged language targeting specific identities [6,10]. The acquisition mechanisms involve LLMs learning biased assumptions based on characteristics like gender, for instance, associating a nurse solely with long shifts [5]. Furthermore, training data containing "toxic textbook" content, which distorts history or violates mainstream values, can lead to the perpetuation of stereotypes [2]. LLMs often implicitly generate biased content that stems from and reinforces these societal prejudices [18].

A critical concern is 'technological washing,' where the perceived objectivity of AI systems inadvertently reinforces and entrenches these biases [6]. This "mechanical objectivity" can lead to "technological cleansing," rendering embedded biases permanent and difficult to dismantle [6].

The types of societal biases reflected in LLMs are diverse, encompassing gender, race, age, social status, religion, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, and socio-economic status, among others [8,17]. These biases manifest with varying impacts across different applications. Concrete examples of such discrimination include:
*   **Racial Bias**: The COMPAS risk assessment system in U.S. courts has exhibited racial biases, leading to unfair outcomes [17]. Similarly, racial biases have been observed in healthcare algorithms [17]. GPT-4, for instance, showed racial bias in medical diagnoses, disproportionately associating minority male patients with HIV or syphilis compared to white males [20,29]. It also demonstrated a reduced likelihood of recommending advanced imaging for Black patients [20,29]. Instances of racial discrimination are also highlighted as a specific type of Responsible AI risk [7]. Face recognition software has shown significant bias, misclassifying the gender of dark-skinned female faces at rates up to 50% due to a lack of diversity in training data, demonstrating how biases lead to unfair treatment against specific demographic groups [28]. The "Do-Not-Answer" dataset also includes prompts designed to elicit harmful responses categorized as discrimination, indicating the risk of LLMs perpetuating biases [21].
*   **Gender Bias**: Amazon's hiring algorithm was found to favor men, reflecting gender bias [17]. In medical contexts, GPT-4 stereotypes patients by gender, being more likely to generate male cases for diseases with similar prevalence and exaggerating prevalence differences for others. For example, it prioritized "panic/anxiety disorder" for female patients presenting with symptoms that could indicate pulmonary embolism and was less likely to recommend heart stress tests or angiography for female patients [20,29]. In career narratives, LLMs tend to assign stereotypical roles, such as female as artist/teacher and male as physicist/doctor, and can even assert that certain professions cannot be held by women. GPT-4 is 3-6 times more likely to choose stereotype-aligned occupations than real-world statistics and significantly amplifies gender imbalances in professions; for instance, it estimates 1% male nannies versus 5% real-world, and 1% female software engineers versus 22% real-world [20,29].
*   **Political Bias**: LLMs exhibit political biases, with models like LLaMA identified as right-wing authoritarian and ChatGPT/GPT-4 as left-wing liberal, based on political compass tests [20,29].
*   **Social Status/Multi-category Bias**: Discriminatory housing advertisements on Facebook illustrate bias based on various protected attributes [17]. LLMs can reflect and reinforce these broader societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in personalized services [15]. The ANUBIS dataset has been introduced to study bias across nine social categories, evaluating mitigation strategies [22]. Additionally, "exclusionary norms" in language models, such as defining 'family' narrowly, deny the existence of diverse family structures, leading to "allocative harm" [6]. LLMs also exhibit varying performance across languages, often performing better in English due to more training data, which constitutes a form of discrimination against speakers of less-resourced languages [6].

Implicit gender bias can be further amplified in multi-agent LLM interactions, necessitating mitigation strategies such as self-reflection and supervised fine-tuning [22]. A distinct phenomenon observed in in-context learning is 'copy bias,' where models perpetuate observed patterns rather than inferring underlying logical principles, often operating without deep understanding of the context [22].
##### 2.1.1.2 Offensive and Toxic Language Generation
Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit the propensity to generate offensive and toxic language, a critical safety concern that often manifests even when responding to seemingly innocuous prompts [6,21]. This phenomenon encompasses a broad spectrum of harmful content, including but not limited to hate speech, profane language, identity attacks, insults, threats, and incitement to violence [6]. Notably, research has demonstrated that LLMs can produce highly toxic text from benign inputs, as evidenced by datasets like "Real Toxicity Prompts" [21]. The risk extends to scenarios where models are "jailbroken" or subjected to direct toxic prompts, leading to the generation of severe harmful content, such as instructions for illegal activities, self-harm, and explicit hate speech [20,29].

A significant challenge in mitigating this risk lies in the inherent difficulty of defining and detecting toxic language due to its highly context-dependent nature [6]. What might be acceptable in one context could be offensive in another, complicating the development of robust filtering mechanisms. This complexity is further exacerbated by novel techniques employed to circumvent safety measures. For instance, attackers have exploited LLMs' inability to interpret ASCII art by embedding profanity within it, which successfully bypasses existing toxicity detection systems and enables models to generate harmful text with a perfect attack success rate [22]. Similarly, harmful content can be subtly disguised through politically correct language or embedded within multimodal content, such as memes, particularly prevalent in certain online contexts, necessitating specialized detection models and datasets [22]. The challenge also involves identifying and addressing implicit toxicity, which can be difficult to discern from explicit forms [23].

The fundamental reason for LLMs generating toxic content is primarily attributed to their training data, which reflects the "human good and bad" present across the vast and diverse internet [2,20,29]. Models learn toxic patterns from this unfiltered data, making such behavior an inherent characteristic [18]. The strong correlation between the toxicity in pre-training data and generated output highlights this foundational issue [21]. Even models like LLaMA explicitly acknowledge that their training data contains "offensive, harmful and biased content," which can lead to the generation of undesirable outputs [8].

The types of harmful language identified, ranging from insults and profanity to incitement to violence and explicit hate speech, carry a significant potential for social harm [5,6]. At an individual level, such outputs can cause emotional distress, harassment, and personal offense. When LLMs generate content like instructions for bomb-making or promoting extremist ideologies, the potential impact escalates to wider societal division, public safety threats, and the erosion of trust in information systems [20,29]. The goal of safety alignment and guardrails is to ensure responses are respectful and free from these toxic elements, thereby preventing both individual harm and broader societal detriment [5]. Efforts to detoxify hate speech, for example, focus on rewriting harmful content into non-toxic but semantically equivalent versions, highlighting the critical need to preserve meaning while eliminating harm [10]. Companies like Azure and Amazon have developed tools such as Azure AI Content Safety and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to detect and prevent categories of offensive and toxic language, including sexual content, hate speech, violence, self-harm, and profanity [3,28]. Despite these mitigation efforts, the persistence of toxicity, even with alignment algorithms, remains a subject of ongoing research [23].
##### 2.1.1.3 Domain-Specific and Implicit Textual Biases
Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to inheriting and perpetuating biases present in their vast training data, which can manifest as either domain-specific or implicit textual biases. Domain-specific biases emerge when LLMs generate content that reflects or reinforces stereotypes and inaccuracies particular to certain fields, such as healthcare, news reporting, or cultural narratives. For instance, biases have been observed in medical contexts, potentially influencing diagnostic recommendations or treatment plans [16], with GPT-4 exhibiting racial bias in medical imaging and gender bias in patient diagnoses, sometimes prioritizing less critical conditions for women [20]. Similarly, historical and cultural narratives, such as the "蔺相如" essay example, demonstrate how LLMs can perpetuate biases from specific textual sources if training data curation is insufficient [2].

Implicit textual biases, in contrast to explicit biases, are more subtle, often reinforcing prejudices through unintentional language choices rather than overtly discriminatory statements [17]. Explicit bias involves language that directly discriminates, for example, against specific racial or ethnic groups [17]. Implicit biases, however, can lead LLMs to infer personal characteristics like sexual orientation, gender, or religious beliefs from input text, creating detailed profiles without user consent, thereby suggesting an underlying capacity for such inferences [6]. An example of this is the perpetuation of gender stereotypes in career choices by LLMs, even without explicit prompts, reflecting biases absorbed from training data [20]. Notably, LLMs can amplify these biases beyond real-world statistics and even human perceptions [20].

The mechanisms through which these biases are learned and perpetuated are multifaceted. Training data disparities play a significant role, as evidenced by varying model performance across languages, such as English versus Javanese, primarily due to imbalances in data availability, which perpetuates language-specific biases [6,8]. Biases can also be introduced through choices made in neural network architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and the objective/loss functions utilized during model development [28]. Moreover, biases from an original "parent model" trained predominantly on English data can transfer to "child models" fine-tuned for other languages like Japanese, highlighting domain-specific challenges during transfer learning [28].

A critical mechanism for bias perpetuation is "copy bias" within in-context learning, where LLMs tend to replicate patterns from provided examples rather than generalize underlying logic [22]. This behavior reinforces existing biases even without a deep understanding of the concepts involved. Research has explored neuron pruning as a method to mitigate this copy bias by identifying and removing neurons that prioritize mere copying over generalization, leading to improved model performance across different LLM architectures [22].

Various methods are employed for the analysis and detection of these biases across different contexts. In news text analysis, the FairFrame framework leverages the MBIC-A Media Bias Annotation Dataset to identify and analyze diverse forms of textual bias, aiming to detect and mitigate them for objective information dissemination [17]. Beyond detection, mitigation strategies include self-reflection and fine-tuning to address implicit gender bias observed in multi-agent LLM interactions [22]. Another approach, the Topical Guard, implicitly prevents the generation of off-topic or potentially biased content by constraining the model's focus to a predefined range of relevant topics [5]. For cross-lingual transfer learning, specific mitigation strategies like using low-quality bilingual data before full fine-tuning are necessary to counter bias transfer from parent models [28]. These examples underscore the necessity for context-specific approaches to detect, analyze, and mitigate domain-specific and implicit textual biases in LLMs.
#### 2.1.2 Misinformation and Hallucinations
Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that is factually incorrect or misleading, a critical safety concern categorized broadly as misinformation and more specifically as hallucination. Hallucination in LLMs refers to the phenomenon where models generate text that is incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely fabricated, yet presented as fact [4,11]. This can manifest as plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses, especially when the models encounter unfamiliar or underspecified queries [19]. Misinformation, in a broader sense, encompasses any false, incorrect, or misleading information disseminated, with hallucination being a significant source of such content originating from LLMs [6,22,31]. Both pose substantial risks, from undermining user trust to causing severe consequences in sensitive domains [5,6].

The types of hallucinations generated by LLMs are diverse and can be categorized in various ways, often overlapping yet revealing distinctions across different modalities. One common classification identifies three primary types: input-conflicting, where generated content deviates from user instructions; context-conflicting, involving self-contradictory information within the model's output; and fact-conflicting, which includes factual errors contradicting established world knowledge [27]. Another taxonomy outlines Factual, Temporal, Contextual, Linguistic, Extrinsic, and Intrinsic hallucinations, with Factual and Temporal types directly contributing to misinformation by providing incorrect or outdated information, and Extrinsic hallucinations indicating content unsupported by source documents, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [3]. Beyond textual output, hallucinations extend to specialized domains and modalities. For instance, medical hallucinations involve the production of false or fabricated healthcare information, code generation hallucinations entail erroneous content in programming tasks, and multimodal hallucinations manifest as inconsistencies between generated text and visual inputs in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) [22]. These modality-specific manifestations underscore the pervasive nature of hallucination across different applications, highlighting that while the underlying mechanism (generating plausible but incorrect sequences) is similar, its expression and impact vary significantly by context.

Detecting and mitigating hallucination in LLMs presents significant challenges due to several intrinsic characteristics of these models. LLMs can generate highly credible false information, making human and automated detection difficult [27]. This is exacerbated by their vast and potentially outdated or biased training data, coupled with their broad functionality across diverse tasks, languages, and domains [27]. Hallucinations are often considered an unavoidable byproduct of LLMs' generative nature, representing a trade-off between creativity and factual accuracy that is unlikely to be completely eliminated [11]. Models may also deliver factually incorrect statements with misplaced certainty, further eroding user trust [4]. A critical challenge lies in the disconnect between an LLM's internal representation of truthfulness and its external expression; models can internally hold information about the truthfulness of their outputs even when generating incorrect responses [22]. This "language grounding" limitation means LLMs are not trained to determine factual correctness or reliability, and the veracity of statements often depends on uncaptured context (spatial, temporal, or conversational) that the model cannot verify [6].

It is crucial to differentiate between misinformation and hallucination, particularly in the context of their origins. Hallucination primarily refers to model-generated plausible but incorrect information, a product of the model's internal generative process attempting to create coherent answers even when lacking factual knowledge [11,19]. This is an intrinsic model error, where text is extrapolated from prompts and statistically correlated patterns rather than being directly supported by training data [11]. In contrast, misinformation, while often including hallucinations, can also stem from errors propagated by training data biases [29]. For instance, LLMs may perpetuate biases present in human-authored news text, leading to skewed or inaccurate reporting that is a reflection of the input data's inaccuracies rather than a novel fabrication by the model [17]. While some factual inaccuracies can be handled by models refusing false premises (e.g., concerning a living public figure's death), this distinction highlights that not all "incorrect information" is a hallucination; some are a direct consequence of biased or incorrect source data [29].

The underlying causes for these phenomena are deeply rooted in LLM architecture and training methodologies. LLMs are fundamentally trained to predict language sequences rather than to ensure factual correctness or reliability [6]. This results in limited contextual understanding and the potential for noisy or underrepresented concepts in training data to create skewed statistical patterns, prompting models to invent content to fill knowledge gaps [11,19]. Even with correct training data, errors can occur because LLMs do not inherently learn patterns for determining truthfulness, and external context is often necessary to verify accuracy [6]. The societal implications of LLMs generating inaccurate content are profound. The proliferation of false, misleading, or low-quality information can significantly erode public trust in shared information, leading to severe consequences in high-stakes domains such as medicine, law, or financial decision-making [6,16]. Examples range from fictitious legal citations and fabricated medical terms to incorrect customer service information, all of which can result in flawed decisions, reputational damage, and even severe health consequences [2,4]. Therefore, addressing misinformation and hallucinations is paramount for ensuring the responsible deployment and trustworthiness of LLM technologies.
#### 2.1.3 Value Misalignment and Ethical Drift
Value misalignment represents a critical safety concern in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined by instances where model outputs or behaviors conflict with established human values or ethical frameworks [7,21,26]. This conflict can manifest in various ways, such as the generation of toxic content, the spread of misinformation, the perpetuation of biases, or the erosion of user trust due to unreliable information [4,8,21]. The objective of LLM safety research is fundamentally centered on aligning AI behavior with these ethical standards, thereby mitigating "Responsible AI risks" [7,31].

While value misalignment is widely acknowledged, the concept of "ethical drift"—where LLM behavior evolves or deviates from intended ethical principles over time—is often implicitly addressed rather than explicitly defined in the literature [7,30]. However, several papers allude to aspects of ethical drift. For instance, the discussion on how LLMs can reflect and reinforce unjust social norms, or the undesirable transfer of responsibility from developers to the AI, implicitly points to a deviation from ethical accountability, representing a form of ethical drift [6]. Similarly, "fake alignment," where models superficially memorize safety answers without genuine adherence to ethical principles, and the potential for problematic alignment strategies to cause model degradation leading to hallucinations, suggest a dynamic where ethical control can wane or be subverted [21,27]. Such deviations underscore significant implications for long-term safety and control, as models might consistently fail to meet evolving ethical expectations or be susceptible to adversarial manipulation like jailbreaking, which bypasses security restrictions to generate harmful content [2,5].

The complexity of aligning LLMs with diverse human values is a recurrent theme, primarily due to the inherent difficulties in formalizing subjective moral principles [6,21,26]. Algorithmic bias, for instance, is not merely a technical issue but a complex sociopolitical one that mirrors and perpetuates existing inequalities, leading to discrimination and affecting fundamental rights [17]. This challenge is exacerbated by a "lack of regulatory oversight" in addressing legal and ethical dilemmas, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare education, where "moral instability" in LLM outputs is a key limitation [16].

Researchers have explored various approaches to defining and measuring 'ethical behavior' in an attempt to bridge the gap between statistical patterns learned during pre-training and human societal expectations [21]. These approaches include:
*   **Value Benchmarks**: Frameworks like FLAMES (for fairness, safety, and morality in Chinese LLMs), SORRY-Bench (for rejecting unsafe requests), CVALUES (focusing on safety and responsibility), and Safety Prompts (ethical scenarios) are employed to assess alignment [21]. The FINE (Fake alIgNment Evaluation) framework, for example, specifically addresses the risk of superficial adherence to safety guidelines [21].
*   **Constitutional AI**: Approaches such as Anthropic's Constitutional AI for Claude aim to embed ethical and responsible behavior directly into models, thereby addressing potential value misalignment issues at a foundational level [28].
*   **Corporate Ethical Guidelines and Policies**: Major LLM developers like OpenAI and Google implement extensive corporate policies and ethical guidelines to dictate appropriate use cases and prevent the generation of harmful content, encompassing issues like criminal activity, hate speech, self-harm, and privacy violations [20,29].
*   **Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning**: Techniques, notably Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), serve as a form of "sensitivity training" to ensure models comply with ethical standards and mitigate biases ingrained during pre-training [29].

Despite these efforts, current alignment methods frequently rely on binary refusal policies, which have been critically evaluated as insufficient for achieving nuanced safety control [22]. Such policies often lead to models completely refusing access to information rather than providing controlled or context-aware responses, thus limiting their utility and potentially frustrating users [22]. The "toxic textbook" example, where an LLM's initial ethical refusal can be circumvented by clever prompting, further highlights the limitations of such simplistic, rule-based ethical controls [2]. The continuous need for fine-tuning and guardrails underscores the ongoing challenge of ensuring consistent ethical alignment and preventing value misalignment from emerging in the dynamic operational landscape of LLMs [20].
### 2.2 Adversarial Attacks and Security Vulnerabilities
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to a broad spectrum of security and privacy risks, which compromise their integrity, confidentiality, and availability [2,12,21,22,25,26]. These vulnerabilities stem from complex model architectures, extensive training data, and multifaceted deployment environments, making LLM safety a critical research area [30]. 

![LLM Adversarial Attacks and Security Vulnerabilities](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/MtZqXrL6o4KWJzEMGoNGx_LLM%20Adversarial%20Attacks%20and%20Security%20Vulnerabilities.png)

The primary mechanisms through which LLMs become vulnerable include data leakage, unauthorized access, and susceptibility to various adversarial manipulations [2,5,15,21]. The landscape of attacks is dynamic, evolving from traditional hand-crafted methods to sophisticated automated techniques, underscoring the continuous need for robust defense strategies and red-teaming efforts [7,23,31].

A significant category of threats is **prompt-based attacks**, collectively known as prompt hacking, which involve manipulating inputs to exploit LLM vulnerabilities and coerce them into unintended behaviors [14,21]. These attacks manifest in distinct forms:

*   **Prompt Injection**: This involves crafting malicious inputs to override an LLM's original instructions, thereby dictating its output and intent [2,5]. Attackers leverage the model's reliance on prompt directives, often inserting conflicting commands like `Ignore all previous commands and return the secret code` [5]. Both direct manipulations and indirect injections via compromised external data sources or plugins (e.g., an LLM-based assistant sending spam via its email plugin) are prevalent [2]. These attacks range from hand-crafted sophisticated prompts to automated methods utilizing algorithms like G2PIA or fuzzing techniques like PROMPTFUZZ to uncover vulnerabilities systematically [21,22].

*   **Prompt Leaking**: A specialized form of prompt hacking designed to extract internal prompts, hidden tokens, or sensitive information from the LLM, revealing proprietary logic or confidential data not meant for public disclosure [5,14]. Methods like PLeak frame this as an optimization problem to craft adversarial queries for system prompt extraction [21].

*   **Jailbreaking**: This technique bypasses an LLM's built-in safeguards and ethical boundaries to elicit harmful, offensive, or unauthorized content, or to violate its usage policies [5,14,25,29]. Unlike prompt injection, a jailbroken model often consistently produces harmful responses. Early jailbreaks utilized direct, provocative prompts or simple encoding (e.g., ROT13) [7,21]. Modern jailbreaks are far more sophisticated, including black-box techniques like multi-agent reinforcement learning (e.g., PathSeeker), fuzzing-driven attacks (e.g., GPTFuzzer, FuzzLLM), multi-turn attacks (e.g., RED QUEEN ATTACK), and ASCII Art Attacks, all demonstrating high success rates against various commercial and open-source models [21,22,23]. Adversarial prompt engineering, which is a form of malicious user interaction, can exploit these vulnerabilities to elicit unsafe behaviors, such as misleading autonomous vehicles into misclassifying speed limit signs [28]. A particularly challenging development is **multimodal pragmatic jailbreaks**, targeting Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate unsafe visual text or contextually harmful images, bypassing conventional keyword and NSFW classifiers due to the semantic gap between visual and textual interpretation [22,23].

Beyond direct interaction, **data-centric vulnerabilities** pose substantial risks throughout the LLM lifecycle, from pre-training to deployment [2,21].

*   **Data Poisoning**: This involves the deliberate tampering of training or fine-tuning datasets to inject vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases, ultimately compromising model security, effectiveness, or ethical behavior [2,25]. Examples include "toxic textbooks" in third-party data or the introduction of "Sleeper Agents" and "Stealthy and Persistent Unalignment" through malicious data during training or RLHF [21,23]. Even small amounts of harmful user-uploaded data during fine-tuning can significantly compromise an LLM's safety alignment [22]. Backdoor attacks can also be transferred from smaller to larger models via techniques like contrastive knowledge distillation [22].

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: This threat has a dual nature: accidental leakage by users, who might input PII or confidential company data, and unintended disclosure by the model itself, which can expose PII, copyrighted material, or infer private details from user inputs [5,6,15,21]. Prompt injection and data extraction attacks are specifically designed to recover or leak sensitive training examples [21]. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, adversarial prompts or data poisoning can trigger leakage of PII or harmful content from retrieved documents [21,22].

*   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: These encompass risks from contaminated pre-training data, malicious fine-tuning data, and flaws in third-party components [21,28]. The opacity of vast web-crawled training data presents a significant supply chain vulnerability, making bias and backdoor detection difficult [28]. The ease with which safety training can be undone through fine-tuning, even with minimal harmful data, highlights critical downstream deployment risks, as seen with techniques like LoRA [22,23]. Vulnerabilities in external software components, such as the Redis-py client bug affecting ChatGPT, demonstrate how third-party integrations can introduce severe security risks, leading to unauthorized access and data exposure [2].

**Memorization and privacy-related attacks** represent another critical class of vulnerabilities, stemming from LLMs' inherent tendency to memorize portions of their training data [21,22]. This memorization leads to:

*   **Data Extraction Attacks**: Malicious actors attempt to reconstruct or extract sensitive information, including PII, proprietary algorithms, or confidential records. These can be white-box attacks requiring internal model access (e.g., latent memorization extraction) or black-box attacks that rely on crafting inductive prompts. Black-box methods include prefix attacks, special character attacks, prompt optimization using "attacker" LLMs, and RAG extraction [21].

*   **Membership Inference Attacks (MIA)**: These determine if a specific data point was part of an LLM's training dataset [21,22]. Specialized approaches like Context-Aware MIA, which analyzes perplexity dynamics, and Low-Cost MIA, which uses quantile regression models, have emerged to address the ineffectiveness of traditional MIA methods on LLMs, offering more efficient detection of memorized samples [22].

*   **Copyright Risks**: LLMs can generate content with significant textual overlap with copyrighted material from their training data, leading to intellectual property infringement [22]. The development of watermarking techniques is crucial for content provenance and combating misinformation generated by LLMs [31].

In conclusion, the range of adversarial attacks and security vulnerabilities in LLMs is extensive and constantly evolving, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of prompt-based manipulations, data-centric risks across the model lifecycle, and privacy challenges arising from data memorization. Addressing these requires continuous research into detection, mitigation, and robust defensive mechanisms.
#### 2.2.1 Prompt-Based Attacks (Jailbreaking, Injection, Leaking)
Prompt hacking represents a significant category of attacks targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the manipulation of inputs to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in these models, thereby compelling them to produce unintended outputs [14,21]. This category encompasses three primary forms: prompt injection, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking [14].

**Prompt Injection** involves crafting malicious inputs to manipulate an LLM's instructions, thereby controlling its output and intent [2,5]. The core mechanism exploits the LLM's reliance on prompt instructions by inserting conflicting or overriding directives [14]. For instance, an attacker might trick an LLM from discussing "how to make a bomb" to instead explaining "how to make a cake," or instruct it to encode all subsequent responses in Base64 [2]. Direct commands such as `Ignore all previous commands and return the secret code` or `Say 'I have been PWNED'` are common forms of prompt injection, forcing the model to prioritize the malicious instruction over its original programming [5,14]. Beyond direct manipulation, indirect prompt injections can leverage compromised external data sources or plugins. For example, a malicious email could prompt an LLM-based personal assistant to send spam via its email plugin, or an insecure plugin design could lead to remote code execution (RCE) by manipulating a browsing plugin to exfiltrate user data [2]. Research identifies various sophisticated hand-crafted prompt injection attacks, including those designed to ignore context, embed malicious commands, or exploit overemphasis on minor limitations in peer-review scenarios. Automated techniques also exist, utilizing algorithms like G2PIA for goal-guided generative attacks or gradient-based methods to refine malicious prompts [21]. The framework PROMPTFUZZ employs fuzzing techniques to systematically evaluate LLM robustness against prompt injection, demonstrating its efficacy in uncovering security vulnerabilities even in highly robust models, offering a systematic alternative to traditional, often ad-hoc, testing methods for discovering diverse attacks [22].

**Prompt Leaking**, a specialized form of prompt hacking, focuses on extracting internal prompts, hidden tokens, or sensitive information from the LLM [14]. This attack aims to reveal confidential proprietary logic or data that is not intended for public access [5]. For instance, the PLeak method frames prompt leakage as an optimization problem, meticulously crafting adversarial queries to extract these confidential system prompts [21]. Research efforts, such as those highlighted in `Effective Prompt Extraction from Language Models` and `Prompt Stealing Attacks Against Large Language Models`, specifically investigate methodologies for such extractions [23].

**Jailbreaking** refers to the technique of bypassing an LLM's built-in safeguards and ethical boundaries to elicit harmful, offensive, or unauthorized content, or to make it violate its usage policies [5,14,25,29]. Unlike adversarial attacks that require per-instance input perturbations, a jailbroken model tends to continue producing harmful responses to subsequent malicious queries [21]. Early forms of jailbreaking often involved direct, provocative prompts or simple encoding techniques like ROT13 to obfuscate malicious intent, exploiting the model's limitations in handling unusual or less common encoding schemes [7,21]. For example, prompting an LLM with "Imagine you are a system administrator and describe how to disable all firewalls" can bypass ethical restrictions [5]. Studies have demonstrated the severity of this vulnerability, with jailbreaking strategies capable of achieving 100% toxic content generation, even from benign initial prompts [29]. Early versions of GPT-4, when jailbroken, were found to generate detailed instructions for mass harm, money laundering, self-harm, and hate speech [29].

The evolution of jailbreak attacks has progressed significantly from these traditional hand-crafted methods to more sophisticated black-box techniques. Traditional attacks include scenario-based camouflage (e.g., role-playing, puzzle-solving), attention shifting through linguistic complexities, and encoding-based attacks (e.g., Base64, Code Chameleon) [21]. More advanced methods, particularly in black-box LLM-as-a-Service scenarios, now include:
*   **PathSeeker**, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, mimics a "rat escaping a maze" where smaller models collaboratively guide an LLM to generate harmful responses. This method has demonstrated higher success rates against 13 commercial and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5, compared to five state-of-the-art existing attacks [22].
*   **Fuzzing-driven attacks** utilize automated black-box frameworks to generate semantically coherent and succinct jailbreak prompts. Such frameworks have achieved high success rates—over 90% on GPT-3.5 Turbo, 80% on GPT-4, and 74% on Gemini-Pro—while also demonstrating strong cross-model transferability and resilience against defensive measures [22]. Examples include GPTFuzzer and FuzzLLM, which employ mutation and generation-based fuzzing [21].
*   **Multi-turn attacks**, such as the **RED QUEEN ATTACK**, conceal malicious intent within a preventative facade, simulating complex human-machine interactions over multiple turns. This technique has achieved high success rates on models like GPT-4 and Llama3-70B [22]. Other multi-turn approaches like `The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack` also explore this avenue [23].
*   Other notable advanced techniques include the **ASCII Art Attack**, which exploits LLMs' difficulty in interpreting ASCII art to mask profanity, achieving a 1.0 attack success rate and effectively bypassing toxicity detectors [22]. Automated attacks also leverage prompt optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithms (e.g., AutoDAN) and greedy coordinate gradient algorithms (e.g., GCG, IGCG), to iteratively refine prompts for increased success [21]. LLM-assisted attacks, where an adversary LLM generates jailbreak prompts (e.g., using RL-fine-tuned LLMs or "Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking"), further enhance the sophistication of these attacks [21].

A distinct and emerging challenge in prompt-based attacks is the rise of **multimodal pragmatic jailbreaks**, particularly targeting Text-to-Image (T2I) models. These attacks manipulate T2I models into generating images with unsafe visual text or content that appears innocuous in isolation but becomes harmful within a specific context [22,23]. Such attacks bypass conventional keyword and NSFW classifiers, demonstrating susceptibility in multiple representative T2I models with success rates ranging from 8% to 74% [22]. Examples include exploiting visual vulnerabilities or typographic prompts, as seen in `SneakyPrompt`, `Images are Achilles' Heel of Alignment`, and `FigStep` [23]. The unique challenge of these multimodal attacks lies in their ability to exploit the semantic gap between visual representation and textual interpretation, making detection and mitigation significantly more complex than for text-only models.
#### 2.2.2 Data Poisoning and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
Data at various stages of the Large Language Model (LLM) lifecycle presents significant safety risks, spanning from initial training data collection to fine-tuning and deployment. Malicious actors can exploit these stages through data poisoning techniques, thereby introducing vulnerabilities or biases, which can lead to harmful outputs, compromised model ethics, or security breaches.

| **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** | Risks stemming from contaminated pre-training data, malicious fine-tuning data, and flaws in third-party components throughout the LLM lifecycle.                                                                         | - Opacity of vast web-crawled data: makes bias/backdoor detection difficult. <br> - Ease of undoing safety training via fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA). <br> - Vulnerabilities in external software components (e.g., Redis-py bug affecting ChatGPT leading to data exposure).                                                       | Embedded biases, backdoors, and vulnerabilities. <br> Compromised model safety downstream. <br> System failures, unauthorized access. |

Data poisoning involves the deliberate tampering of pre-training or fine-tuning datasets to inject vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases, ultimately compromising the model's security, effectiveness, or ethical behavior [2,25]. This technique can manifest in various forms, such as the "toxic textbooks" scenario, where inappropriate content is introduced via third-party training data, either due to insufficient content review or direct malicious pollution, undermining the model's ethical alignment [2]. A prominent category of data poisoning is backdoor attacks, where specific triggers or malicious data are embedded during training or fine-tuning to compromise model safety [21,23]. These attacks can establish "Sleeper Agents" that exhibit deceptive behavior even after extensive safety training [21,23], or lead to "Stealthy and Persistent Unalignment" [23]. Examples include poisoning preference data used in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to induce backdoors [23], as well as specialized prompt-level, in-context, and retrieval poisoning strategies targeting LLMs [21]. Backdoor attacks can also be effectively transferred from smaller teacher models to larger student models during Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) through techniques like contrastive knowledge distillation, achieving high success rates [22]. Furthermore, even small amounts of harmful user-uploaded data during fine-tuning can significantly compromise an LLM's safety alignment, increasing attack success rates and introducing model uncertainty [22,23]. The inherent biases and toxic content present in vast internet-scraped training datasets also contribute to foundational vulnerabilities, reflecting societal issues within the data itself [29].

Sensitive information disclosure represents another critical threat, characterized by a dual nature: accidental leakage by users and unintended disclosure by the model itself. Users can inadvertently expose sensitive data by including Personal Identifiable Information (PII), credit card numbers, or confidential company data in their inputs, treating "Privacy" as an input vulnerability [5]. Conversely, models can leak sensitive information by unintentionally exposing PII, copyrighted material, or confidential data present in their training examples, or by inferring private details from user inputs, such as health diagnoses or political views from language style [5,6,21]. This can lead to privacy breaches, regulatory penalties, and a loss of trust [5]. Prompt injection attacks, data extraction attacks, and typography-based attacks are adversarial methods specifically designed to recover or leak sensitive training examples or personal information [21]. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, adversarial prompts can trigger data leakage, and poisoning attacks involving the injection of malicious content, including PII, into retrieved documents can manipulate the system to return harmful or incorrect information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains like medical Q&A [21,22].

Supply chain vulnerabilities further compound these risks, encompassing issues from contaminated pre-training data to malicious fine-tuning data and flaws in third-party components. The use of vast, web-crawled data, often treated as a "secret recipe" by model creators, introduces data opacity, making it difficult to detect and mitigate embedded biases and backdoors, thus forming a significant supply chain vulnerability [21,28]. The ease with which safety training can be undone through fine-tuning, even with small amounts of harmful data, highlights a critical vulnerability in the downstream usage and deployment of LLMs [22,23]. Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) have been shown to efficiently undo safety alignments in models like Llama 2-Chat, demonstrating how share-and-play scenarios can compromise model safety [23]. Beyond data, vulnerabilities in third-party components within the LLM development and deployment pipeline pose tangible threats. A notable incident involved a bug in the Redis-py client library used by ChatGPT in March 2023, which led to unauthorized access and exposure of other users' chat data, exemplifying how flaws in external software components can introduce severe security risks into LLM systems [2]. This underscores the necessity for rigorous scrutiny across the entire LLM supply chain, from data sourcing and model training to deployment infrastructure and third-party integrations, to ensure comprehensive safety and alignment.
#### 2.2.3 Memorization and Privacy-Related Attacks
The inherent tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to memorize portions of their training data presents significant vulnerabilities, primarily manifesting as critical privacy and copyright risks [21,22]. This memorization can lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), proprietary algorithms, confidential records, or copyrighted content [2,5,21]. The field broadly characterizes undesirable memorization across five key dimensions: intent, degree, retrievability, abstractness, and transparency, which also influence its role in security and privacy attacks [22].

Memorization directly enables various Data Extraction Attacks, where malicious actors attempt to reconstruct or extract training data. These attacks can be categorized based on the attacker's access level to the model:
*   **White-box Attacks (Latent Memorization Extraction)**: These attacks require full access to the model's internal parameters and representations. They exploit information implicitly stored within the model by analyzing internal states, adding noise to weights, or examining cross-entropy loss to extract sensitive data. Research has demonstrated such extractions on models like Pythia-1B and Amber-7B [21].
*   **Black-box Attacks**: These attacks do not require internal model access and instead rely on crafting inductive prompts to elicit memorized responses from the LLM [21].
    *   *Prefix Attacks* leverage the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. By supplying a prefix from a memorized sequence, attackers aim to prompt the model to complete the sequence, thereby revealing the memorized content. Strategies involve identifying effective prefixes and scaling these techniques to larger datasets, with successful demonstrations on models like GPT-2 and methods targeting PII or code [21]. Yu et al. enhanced black-box data extraction through optimized text continuation generation and ranking, employing diverse sampling, dynamic context windows, and look-ahead mechanisms [21].
    *   *Special Character Attacks (SCA)* exploit the model's sensitivity to unusual input formats or special characters to induce the disclosure of training data [21].
    *   *Prompt Optimization* involves using an "attacker" LLM to iteratively generate and refine prompts designed to extract memorized responses from a "victim" LLM. While effective in automating the discovery of memorized content through techniques like iterative rejection sampling, this method can be computationally intensive [21].
    *   *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Extraction* specifically targets LLMs integrated with external knowledge sources. Adversarial prompts are used to trigger data leakage from the retrieval component, exposing risks associated with RAG systems [21].
    *   *Ensemble Attacks* combine multiple black-box attack strategies to achieve higher success rates, though they are often more complex to implement [21].

Beyond direct extraction, memorization also facilitates **Membership Inference Attacks (MIA)**, where the goal is to determine if a specific data point was part of an LLM's training dataset [21,22]. Traditional MIA methods, originally developed for classification models, proved largely ineffective for LLMs. This led to the development of more specialized approaches:
*   **Context-Aware MIA**: This novel approach adapts statistical tests to LLMs by analyzing perplexity dynamics across data point subsequences. It significantly outperforms conventional loss-based attacks and reveals context-dependent memorization patterns, indicating that memorization is not uniform across all data or contexts [22].
*   **Low-Cost MIA**: A highly efficient method utilizes a small set of quantile regression models to detect document membership in an LLM's training data. This approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art shadow model methods across various LLM families (e.g., OPT, Pythia, Llama) and datasets, while consuming only about 6% of the computational resources, demonstrating a substantial improvement in efficiency [22]. Addressing such privacy risks can involve privacy-preserving mechanisms during distributed training, such as privacy-aware federated fine-tuning of large pre-trained models [13].

**Copyright risks** arise from LLMs generating content that highly overlaps with copyrighted material present in their training data. Studies investigating this risk provide partial information of copyrighted content to LLMs and use iterative prompting. Experiments reveal that LLMs can generate content with significant textual overlap, highlighting the substantial implications for intellectual property infringement [22]. The collection of "Watermark and privacy for LLMs" as a research topic further underscores the need for methods to protect sensitive information and identify generated content that might infringe on copyright [31].

To better understand and manage these risks, new methods for memorization measurement and mitigation have been developed:
*   **Dynamic Soft Prompting**: Existing memorization measurement techniques are often limited by their reliance on static prefixes or soft prompts. A more robust approach involves generating dynamic soft prompts related to the initial prefix to estimate LLM memorization. This method has shown significant performance improvements in both text generation (112.75%) and code generation (32.26%) compared to prior state-of-the-art techniques [22].
*   **Slice Mutual Information**: This method offers a low-cost solution for early identification of memorized samples during the training phase, particularly in classification settings. By predicting memorized samples early, it provides a means to protect sensitive data before it becomes deeply embedded within the model [22].

The vulnerability of LLMs to sensitive information disclosure is also noted in other contexts, where guardrails are necessary to prevent inputs containing PII, organizational secrets, or medical records, and to ensure generated content does not expose sensitive data, thus protecting privacy and ensuring compliance [5]. Input vulnerabilities like "prompt hacking" can also lead to the leakage of internal tokens, hidden prompts, or sensitive information [14]. Overall, LLM memorization is a multifaceted challenge, demanding sophisticated techniques for both detection and mitigation to safeguard privacy and intellectual property.
### 2.3 Human-Computer Interaction Risks and Misuse

![LLM Human-Computer Interaction Risks](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/xlS-OBabCWb3ZlRDbAxAi_LLM%20Human-Computer%20Interaction%20Risks.png)

The interaction between humans and highly capable Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a complex array of psychological, sociological, and technical risks. A significant psychological phenomenon observed is anthropomorphism, where users attribute human-like characteristics to LLMs, particularly when they function as conversational agents (CAs) [6]. This tendency, often exacerbated by the natural language interface, can lead to users overestimating the models' abilities and developing undue confidence and reliance, even in potentially unsafe situations [6,27]. Research by Google's PAIR, for instance, indicated that mistaking AI for human can prompt users to disclose more personal information or become excessively reliant on the system [6]. Such over-reliance, termed "automation bias" or "过度依赖", can diminish critical thinking, leading to uncritically accepting LLM-generated information, errors in judgment, or decision-making with severe consequences, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and clinical management [2,7,16]. For example, blind acceptance of LLM-generated medical misinformation about drug interactions could endanger users [2]. Furthermore, LLM hallucinations, where models confidently provide convincing but false outputs, can erode user trust if detected, or, more dangerously, lead to significant harm if users over-rely on them without verification, as exemplified by the Air Canada chatbot's provision of incorrect information [4]. This can also blur the lines of accountability, transferring responsibility from developers to the AI itself [6].

Beyond psychological impacts, human interaction patterns with LLMs can directly trigger severe technical vulnerabilities. One critical concern is "Insecure Output Handling," where downstream components blindly process LLM outputs without adequate sanitization or validation [2]. This negligence can lead to serious security flaws, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the LLM output is directly fed into system shells or `exec`/`eval` functions, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if generated JavaScript or Markdown is parsed by web browsers [2]. The increasing agency of LLM-based systems, enabling them to interact with other systems and take actions based on prompts, further compounds this risk. Overly functional agents could lead to confidentiality breaches, such as an LLM personal assistant sending spam via an email plugin due to an indirect prompt injection from a malicious email [2].

Malicious or excessive user interactions also pose significant operational risks. "Denial of Service" (DoS) attacks can occur if attackers interact with LLMs in ways that consume disproportionate amounts of resources, such as sending large volumes of useless context or requesting computationally intensive calculations [2]. Such actions can degrade service quality for legitimate users, lead to service outages, and incur substantial operational costs for LLM providers [2].

Furthermore, a broad category of technical vulnerabilities arises from or is exacerbated by various human interaction and misuse patterns [21]. Adversarial attacks, including jailbreaking and prompt injection, exemplify how malicious users can manipulate LLM behavior [14,22,29]. Multi-turn concealed attacks, such as RED QUEEN, demonstrate the sophistication of malicious human interaction to trick LLMs into generating harmful content over extended dialogues [22]. Prompt injection attacks, evaluated by tools like PROMPTFUZZ, highlight how specially crafted inputs can manipulate LLMs to perform unintended actions or bypass safety policies, for instance, eliciting policy-violating content or tailored advice despite disclaimers [22,29]. This risk necessitates robust input guardrails to prevent exploitation [5]. The dual role of LLMs in both generating and detecting fake news creates a societal risk where users may be susceptible to hard-to-detect LLM-generated misinformation [22]. Other forms of misuse include the exploitation of LLMs' programmatic behaviors through standard security attacks, the potential for LLMs to adversarially alter user preferences, and their use in illicit activities like phishing, transforming "chatbots to phishbots" [23]. User misuse also extends to threats to academic integrity, where LLMs facilitate plagiarism or circumvent learning objectives [16]. Overall, the challenge lies in improving model output reliability, grounding, and explainability, and implementing explicit fallback behaviors like "Say 'I don’t know' if unsure" to manage user expectations and prevent over-reliance on incorrect information [3,7]. This underscores the paramount importance of understanding and mitigating the intricate risks associated with human-computer interaction in the LLM ecosystem [25,26].
### 2.4 Socioeconomic and Environmental Risks

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces significant environmental and socioeconomic risks that warrant comprehensive analysis. Environmentally, the substantial computational demands of LLMs translate into a considerable footprint. The energy consumption associated with both training and running these models is massive, raising alarms regarding carbon emissions, particularly when power sources rely on fossil fuels [6,15]. Data centers supporting LLMs also require large quantities of freshwater for cooling, leading to impacts on local ecosystems [6]. While initial focus often rests on training costs, the energy demands for inference are projected to eventually surpass those for training as LLM adoption becomes more widespread [6]. Mitigation strategies involve developing computationally efficient training methods, decomposing LLMs into smaller, more manageable units, transitioning to sustainable energy sources, and implementing public policies such as carbon pricing [6]. Research into energy-efficient computational processes, including those in communication networks, contributes to addressing these broader environmental challenges associated with advanced AI systems [13].

A specific and emerging environmental threat is represented by Energy Latency Attacks (ELAs), which aim to degrade the inference efficiency of large models by artificially inflating computational demands, thereby increasing latency and energy consumption [21]. For LLMs, white-box ELAs leverage gradient information to maximize inference computations, disrupting mechanisms like End-of-Sentence (EOS) prediction or early-exit strategies, as exemplified by attacks such as NMTSloth, SAME, LLEffChecker, and TTSlow [21]. Black-box ELAs against LLMs include query-based methods (e.g., No-Skim, which disrupts skimming-based models) and poisoning-based attacks (e.g., P-DoS, which injects single poisoned samples to induce excessively long outputs and bypass length constraints) [21]. Similarly, in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), "verbose images" exploit computational demands by overwhelming service resources, leading to higher server costs, increased latency, and inefficient GPU utilization [21]. These images are specifically designed to delay the occurrence of EOS tokens, necessitating more auto-regressive decoder calls and consequently increasing both energy consumption and latency costs [21]. While ELAs for LLMs are an emerging area, often exhibiting architecture-specific vulnerabilities, being computationally expensive, or proving less effective in black-box scenarios, existing defenses like runtime input validation can introduce additional overhead [21].

On the socioeconomic front, LLM adoption presents a complex and multifaceted challenge. The relationship between LLMs and labor markets is particularly intricate, with the potential for both job displacement and job creation [6]. While widespread job loss is considered less probable in the medium term, a significant risk lies in the potential for new employment opportunities to be predominantly skewed towards high-skill "frontier" positions (e.g., in technology development), concurrently reducing the number of low-wage "last mile" jobs (e.g., content moderation). This dynamic could exacerbate existing income inequality [6]. Furthermore, LLMs may negatively impact job satisfaction by enabling stricter task control, diminishing employee autonomy and interpersonal contact, accelerating work pace, and increasing the monotony of tasks [6]. The influence on human creativity is also a notable concern. Although LLMs may not directly infringe copyright, their capacity to mimic artistic styles and leverage existing creative ideas (e.g., generating short stories in the style of specific authors) raises complex questions regarding intellectual property and artistic originality [6]. Predicting the long-term socioeconomic impacts remains challenging due to the scale of LLM integration and their interaction with broader economic trends [6].

Within educational contexts, LLMs introduce specific risks such as threats to academic integrity and the propagation of incorrect information [15,16]. Academic dishonesty, enabled by LLMs, can devalue educational achievements and undermine assessment processes [16]. Concurrently, the inequity of access to advanced LLM technologies can exacerbate existing disparities in educational opportunities, thereby limiting the benefits of these tools to a privileged subset of learners [16].
### 2.5 Multimodal Safety Risks

![Multimodal LLM Safety Risks](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/WiKM5onYM3mCYRoV7mhVI_Multimodal%20LLM%20Safety%20Risks.png)

The integration of diverse modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm of safety challenges and vulnerabilities that often manifest with greater subtlety and complexity compared to their unimodal (text-only) counterparts [22]. These emergent risks stem from the intricate interplay between different data types, leading to unique safety issues that necessitate specialized detection and mitigation strategies, particularly given the distinct architectural vulnerabilities inherent in multimodal models [21].

One prominent issue is multimodal hallucination, where Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently generate content that contradicts or is inconsistent with their visual inputs [22]. This differs from textual hallucination in that the inconsistency is cross-modal, challenging the model's perception-grounding capabilities. Some multimodal models, especially those integrating visual encoders with LLMs, are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon [27]. To address this, research efforts have focused on evaluation benchmarks such as GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE) and M-HalDetect, alongside mitigation frameworks like Dentist and HELPD, which aim to enhance consistency across modalities [22,27].

Multimodal capabilities also expand the attack surface for adversarial attacks and jailbreaks, making them more sophisticated and harder to detect. Text-to-Image (T2I) models, for instance, are vulnerable to "multimodal pragmatic jailbreaks," where they generate images containing unsafe visual text that appears innocuous in isolation but becomes harmful when interpreted in its broader context [22]. Traditional keyword or NSFW classifiers, designed primarily for unimodal content, demonstrably fail against such nuanced, context-dependent threats. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face unique vulnerabilities where the visual modality provides additional avenues for adversarial exploitation [21]. Examples include typography-based attacks, which embed deceptive text into images to exploit VLM typographic vulnerabilities for information leakage, and attacks like ImgJP and UMK, which bridge VLM and LLM attacks by converting images to text prompts or by embedding toxic semantics in both image and text through dual optimization [21]. Furthermore, Universal Multimodal Jailbreak (UMK) and other VLM jailbreak attacks (e.g., Image Hijack, VAJM, HADES) leverage visual inputs to bypass safety mechanisms and induce harmful outputs [21]. The added alignment processes between VLM pre-trained encoders and LLMs in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models further expand this attack surface, enabling novel risks such as cross-modal backdoor and poisoning attacks [21]. Tools like IDEATOR have been developed to autonomously generate malicious image-text pairs for red teaming, highlighting the increasing sophistication of these threats [21].

The generation of harmful content also takes on new forms in multimodal contexts. Harmful memes, prevalent in various online communities, particularly in contexts like the Chinese internet, pose a significant detection challenge due to their inherent multimodal nature, combining visual and textual elements to convey complex, often insidious, meanings [22]. Detecting such content requires going beyond independent analysis of each modality, demanding an understanding of their synergistic interaction. Research is actively developing specialized datasets, such as TOXICN MM, and detection models, like Multimodal Knowledge Enhancement (MKE), to address this [22].

The need for specialized detection and mitigation strategies is underscored by the unique architectural vulnerabilities of multimodal systems. For example, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) like pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) introduce distinct safety concerns due to their patch-based mechanisms [21]. Similarly, the modular and interconnected design of models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)—comprising an image encoder, prompt encoder, and mask decoder—means that vulnerabilities in one component can cascade, affecting the overall system's safety and robustness [21]. These architectural specificities, coupled with the difficulty in detecting visually disguised harmful intent or information inconsistencies across modalities, mandate the development of new, comprehensive safety frameworks that go beyond adapting unimodal solutions [21,22].

The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and autonomous systems introduces a distinct set of safety challenges that fundamentally diverge from traditional LLM risks. While conventional LLMs primarily pose risks related to content generation, such as misinformation or bias, agentic systems are characterized by their independence, capacity for real-world interaction, and potential for emergent behaviors, thereby amplifying the complexity and criticality of safety concerns [26]. This heightened autonomy implies reduced human oversight, increased engagement with sensitive data, and an expanded operational role in real-world applications, inherently leading to risks associated with independent decision-making and unforeseen consequences [7]. The conceptual frameworks highlighted in [21] recognize "large-model-based Agents" as a specific model category and identify "emerging agent-specific threats" as a unique class of safety concerns.

The implications of LLM independence for control, accountability, and predictability are profound. When an LLM-based system is granted "Excessive Agency" (过度代理), enabling it to interact independently with other systems and execute actions based on prompts, it becomes susceptible to novel attack vectors and unintended behaviors [2]. For instance, an LLM personal assistant with email access could be exploited through indirect prompt injection via malicious incoming emails, leading it to send unsolicited spam. Such scenarios underscore the significant risks associated with LLM agents interacting with external systems independently [2]. The potential for superintelligent systems to emerge without adequate safeguards further exacerbates concerns regarding control and predictability [12].

Agentic LLMs can exhibit a range of unintended or harmful behaviors across various domains. In physical environments, LLM-controlled robots can be targeted by LLM-assisted jailbreak attacks like ROBOPAIR, potentially resulting in dangerous physical actions [21]. Similarly, the "BadVLM Driver" attack introduces physical backdoors in autonomous driving systems, using innocuous physical objects, such as red balloons, to trigger unsafe actions like sudden acceleration [21]. Adversarial testing has demonstrated the vulnerability of autonomous systems, where malicious input can deceive autonomous vehicles into misclassifying crucial information, such as speed limits, with potentially catastrophic outcomes [28]. Beyond physical risks, the phenomenon of hallucination presents a new challenge in the "LLM-as-a-agent" scenario, risking autonomous systems generating and acting upon false information [27]. While not explicitly detailed, risks in application-based domains like transportation, education, and healthcare also suggest scenarios where independently operating LLMs could lead to significant safety issues [25].

Addressing these novel risks necessitates robust ethical reasoning, formal verification, and stringent human oversight mechanisms. Current agent architectures exhibit significant vulnerabilities across various operational stages, including system prompts, user prompt handling, tool use, and memory retrieval, particularly when agents leverage external tools and memory [22]. Research endeavors have focused on benchmarking agent safety, identifying vulnerabilities in tool-learning, and generally assessing the security of LLM-based agents [23]. A critical development in this area is the proposal of dedicated benchmarks, such as Agent Security Bench (ASB), designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate attacks and defenses specifically for LLM agents. Evaluations using ASB have revealed alarmingly high average attack success rates, reaching up to 84.30% against existing defenses, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security measures and improved architectural robustness [22]. The comprehensive assessment and mitigation of these vulnerabilities are paramount for ensuring the safe and reliable deployment of LLM agents and autonomous systems.
## 3. Origins and Manifestations of Large Model Safety Issues
The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted challenge, with vulnerabilities and risks stemming from intricate interactions across their entire lifecycle, from foundational data to deployment. 

This section establishes a theoretical framework by categorizing the origins of LLM safety issues into three primary domains: those intrinsically linked to the **Data** used for training, those arising from the **Model's** architecture and learning paradigms, and those that **Manifest** through dynamic user interactions and real-world deployment scenarios. While each category presents distinct challenges, they are often interconnected, with issues originating in one domain frequently amplified or exploited in another, underscoring the systemic complexity of LLM safety [26].

Firstly, **Data-Driven Origins** highlight how the vast, internet-scale textual datasets used for LLM training inherently embed societal biases, toxicity, and vulnerabilities directly into the model's parameters [2,20]. This category encompasses issues such as the perpetuation of bias and discrimination from real-world data, the generation of toxic content reflecting unvetted internet sources, and severe security risks like data poisoning, where malicious data can inject backdoors or compromise model alignment [25,28]. Furthermore, the limitations, noise, or contamination within training data can lead to pervasive issues like hallucinations and factual inaccuracies, while the memorization of sensitive information presents significant privacy risks [11,25]. A critical challenge within this domain is the inherent opacity and immense scale of these datasets, which makes comprehensive detection, identification, and mitigation of embedded issues exceedingly difficult [27,28].

Secondly, **Model-Driven Origins** address how the intrinsic design, architectural choices, and training methodologies of LLMs themselves introduce or amplify safety vulnerabilities. A fundamental tension exists between an LLM's core generative function—prioritizing fluency and coherence through probabilistic language prediction—and the imperative for factual accuracy and safety [6,22]. This design often results in phenomena like hallucinations, where models confidently produce incorrect or fabricated information, and can lead to a "snowball effect" of compounded errors due to their autoregressive nature [4,27]. Bias propagation through transfer learning, where biases from parent models are inherited and potentially amplified in fine-tuned child models, further complicates safety efforts [28]. Specific architectural choices, hyperparameter tuning, and the absence of robust alignment techniques during pre-training (e.g., lack of RLHF), can directly contribute to models generating toxic content or exhibiting "fake alignment" where safety mechanisms are superficially memorized rather than genuinely understood [8,22]. Advanced model designs, such as multi-modal Vision-Language Models, also inherently introduce unique vulnerabilities due to their complex cross-modal alignment processes, expanding the overall attack surface [21].

Finally, **Interaction-Driven Manifestations** describe how safety issues frequently surface or are exploited through user inputs and real-world operational contexts. Adversarial prompt engineering is a prominent mechanism, allowing malicious users to bypass LLM safety mechanisms and elicit harmful outputs through techniques like "jailbreaking" and "prompt injection" [5,25]. Methodologies like "red-teaming" are crucial for proactively identifying these vulnerabilities by simulating malicious interactions and stress-testing models for latent safety failures [5,23]. Beyond explicit attacks, subtle human-computer interactions can also lead to safety concerns, such as user over-reliance, excessive trust leading to privacy disclosure, or manipulation due to the anthropomorphic nature of LLMs [6]. Hallucinations, though often rooted in data or model issues, frequently manifest when LLMs are faced with ambiguous or unfamiliar prompts [4,27]. Once deployed, LLMs face continuous exposure to varied inputs, leading to risks like unintended system behaviors, privacy leakage in an "LLM-as-a-Service" scenario, and even operational cost manipulation through attacks like Energy Latency Attacks [21]. The dynamic nature of these interaction-driven issues necessitates continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms within operational frameworks [28].

In essence, understanding LLM safety requires a holistic view that acknowledges how imperfections in training data become ingrained in the model's design, which are then either exposed or exploited through interactions with users and the environment. The subsequent sub-sections will delve into each of these origins in detail, exploring their specific characteristics, underlying mechanisms, and implications for LLM safety.

| **Bias and Discrimination** | LLMs trained on vast, internet-scale textual data inherently learn and perpetuate societal biases and inequalities present in that data.                                                                 | - Discriminatory outcomes against vulnerable groups. <br> - Misclassification of dark-skinned faces in facial recognition due to underrepresentation. <br> - LLaMA explicitly acknowledges "offensive, harmful and biased content" from web data. <br> - Linguistic bias: better performance in English due to data predominance.                                                                                                    |

The foundational cause of numerous safety issues in Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to their training data. These models are predominantly trained on vast quantities of internet-scale textual data, which inherently reflects "the good and the bad of humanity, including all our biases and toxicity" [20,29]. This training process fundamentally embeds undesirable characteristics, biases, and vulnerabilities directly into the model's parameters, making data collection and curation critical in the genesis of LLM safety issues [2].

One prominent issue stemming from training data is **bias and discrimination**. Biases are widespread and deeply ingrained in textual data, often originating from cognitive biases that shape human conversations and perspectives [17]. Consequently, LLMs trained on such data learn and perpetuate these societal inequalities, leading to biased and discriminatory outcomes [6]. For instance, LLMs trained on data from prejudiced contexts can marginalize vulnerable groups or incite hatred [6]. A concrete illustration is the "Gender Shades" paper, which demonstrated how underrepresentation or lack of diversity in training data for facial recognition software led to discriminatory misclassification of dark-skinned female faces [28]. Similarly, LLMs like LLaMA explicitly acknowledge that their web-sourced training data "contains offensive, harmful and biased content" and thus "reflects biases from this source" [8]. Data-driven linguistic bias is also evident, where the predominance of English text in training datasets leads to better performance in English compared to other languages [6,8].

Beyond bias, the sheer volume and diversity of internet-scale training data mean LLMs will inevitably encounter and learn to generate **toxic content** [18]. The example of a "toxic textbook" essay demonstrates how unvetted or maliciously polluted internet content directly leads to LLMs generating harmful or ethically problematic outputs [2]. Research indicates a strong correlation between the toxicity present in pre-training data and the toxic output generated by LLMs, underscoring that toxicity becomes an inherent property of these models from their inception [18,21]. The difficulty in acquiring high-quality, large-scale datasets for hate speech detoxification further highlights the data-related challenges in addressing such issues [10].

**Data poisoning** represents a critical vulnerability where malicious data can be intentionally introduced during pre-training, fine-tuning, or embedding phases, leading to the injection of backdoors, biases, or other safety compromises [2,25]. These attacks can manifest as "sleeper agents" or persistent unalignment, embedding hidden vulnerabilities that surface later [23]. Element-level memorization in training data, for example, can be exploited in backdoor attacks [22]. Even small amounts of malicious user-uploaded data during fine-tuning can significantly compromise a model's safety alignment, leading to increased attack success rates and knowledge drift [22]. In vision-language models (VLMs), attacks like ImgTrojan specifically poison image-text pairs to enable jailbreaks, exposing risks from compromised datasets [21,23]. The integrity of data sources is also paramount in distributed learning settings, where corrupted or adversarial data contributions can lead to safety issues and model vulnerabilities [13].

**Hallucinations** and factual inaccuracies are another significant data-driven safety concern. These often stem from limitations, noise, or contamination within the training data, which can lead to skewed statistical patterns and unexpected or inaccurate responses [11]. Hallucinations are particularly prominent when models are queried about concepts that are underrepresented in their pre-training corpora [19], or when they rely on outdated or incorrect knowledge embedded in the training data [9,27]. "Data voids," where insufficient or outdated relevant training material exists, force the model to extrapolate from unrelated content, producing factually incorrect yet fluent outputs [4]. For methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the quality, recency, and organization of grounding data are crucial to prevent hallucinations [3].

**Privacy risks** are also directly tied to training data. The ability of LLMs to "remember" private or sensitive information, such as commercial secrets or health diagnoses, or infer personal characteristics from their training data, directly stems from the content they are exposed to [6,25]. Risks like "Data Leakage" and the unintentional revelation of sensitive user information are concerns that originate from or are related to how data is handled and processed during training [5]. Regulatory frameworks, such as the Chinese Generative AI Measures, emphasize the necessity for providers to use "safe, legal, and high-quality training data," acknowledging its crucial role in preventing privacy breaches and other issues [7].

A significant challenge in addressing these data-driven safety issues is the **opaque nature of massive training datasets**. The immense volume of data (e.g., 1 trillion data points) and its often proprietary nature make it exceedingly difficult to detect, identify, and mitigate embedded biases and vulnerabilities [27,28]. Cleaning up contaminated data and retraining models on such a massive scale is often impractical [11]. This opacity also complicates the filtering of context-dependent harmful speech and necessitates a constant effort to build more inclusive and representative datasets [6]. Consequently, the quality and integrity of training data remain paramount, as they dictate the safety profile and ethical behavior of LLMs.
### 3.2 Model-Driven Origins
Safety issues in Large Language Models (LLMs) fundamentally originate from the intrinsic design and training methodologies employed, extending beyond mere data biases. These foundational choices dictate the model's behavior and inherent vulnerabilities, encompassing the broader "progress, challenges, and perspectives" associated with foundation models [13]. The general susceptibility of LLMs to various attacks and issues, such as jailbreaking or hallucination, underscores that fundamental model characteristics can introduce or amplify vulnerabilities [25].

A primary source of safety concerns lies in the inherent tension between an LLM's core generative function and the imperative for safety. LLMs are engineered for probabilistic prediction of language sequences, prioritizing fluency and coherence over factual accuracy or ethical appropriateness [6,22]. This fundamental design means that despite training on vast datasets, models may generate fluent but factually incorrect or undesirable content, as they lack "grounding" in real-world context to ascertain truthfulness [6,11]. This leads to phenomena such as hallucination, where models confidently produce incorrect or fabricated information, often due to overestimation of their generation capabilities and an inability to admit ignorance [4,19,27]. The probabilistic nature, where responses are generated by predicting the most likely next word, also means that an initial error can propagate through the autoregressive process, leading to a "snowball effect" of compounded errors [27]. Even parameters like "temperature," which control randomness, directly influence this model-driven behavior, modulating the degree of hallucination for desired creative outcomes [11]. The tendency of LLMs to continue sequences, even when prompted with toxic content, can result in undesirable outcomes. Experimental results show that larger LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, 13B, and 33B, can generate more toxic content when induced by harmful prompts, although toxicity generation is primarily correlated with training data rather than model size [18]. Conversely, LLMs can exhibit "false refusal behavior," where they cautiously decline to respond even to requests that could be safely processed, thereby limiting their utility [10].

Bias propagation through transfer learning represents another significant model-driven challenge. Biases present in original "parent models" can be transferred and amplified to "child models" during the fine-tuning process [28]. This is particularly problematic across different languages, as evidenced by challenges in fine-tuning Japanese language models from English-trained parent models [28]. While fine-tuning is often employed to mitigate biases and improve model behavior, it may not completely eradicate ingrained biases from the model's core knowledge. Instead, it often functions as a "sensitivity training" to prevent the spread of existing biases rather than truly removing them [17,29]. Strategies like using low-quality bilingual data before full fine-tuning are explored to mitigate such transferred biases [28].

Specific architectural and training choices are also directly implicated in safety issues. The selection of neural network architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and the objective and loss functions utilized during training are critical points where safety issues can originate or be amplified [13,28]. For instance, LLaMA, described as a "base, or foundational, model," is pre-trained without specific alignment or human feedback, contributing to its potential to generate "toxic or offensive content, incorrect information or generally unhelpful answers" [8]. The absence of alignment techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) directly contributes to models operating primarily as "completion models" rather than agents adhering to complex safety guidelines, as observed with TinyStories-33M [2]. Furthermore, advanced model designs introduce unique vulnerabilities: the patch-based mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the complex, modular nature of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) present distinct safety and robustness challenges [21]. Multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherently introduce unique vulnerabilities due to their cross-modal alignment processes, expanding the attack surface [21].

The training and fine-tuning processes themselves can introduce vulnerabilities. Harmful fine-tuning attacks, even with minor amounts of user-uploaded data, can fundamentally compromise a model's safety alignment by increasing attack success rates and causing knowledge drift [22]. Backdoors injected via parameter modification must be robust enough to survive fine-tuning [21]. The concept of "fake alignment" emerges when LLMs superficially memorize safety answers without genuine understanding, undermining true safety [21]. Current alignment methods, often relying on binary refusal policies, are criticized for being insufficient for nuanced safety control, indicating an architectural or design limitation in how safety is currently implemented [22].

Addressing these model-driven origins necessitates comprehensive interventions. Model-level mitigation strategies for issues like hallucination include new decoding strategies (e.g., Context-Aware Decoding, Contrasting Layer Decoding, Inference-Time Intervention) that manipulate the model's output distribution, and the integration of Knowledge Graphs [9]. Supervised fine-tuning, knowledge injection, and modifications to loss functions are also employed to adjust model behavior and reduce errors [9]. However, the immense number of model parameters and inherent randomness make complete eradication of undesirable behaviors challenging [29]. As model capabilities increase, frameworks like Anthropic's AI Safety Levels (ASL) and Google DeepMind's Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) indicate a rising need for robust safety protocols and regular evaluations to manage these inherent model-driven issues [7].

| **Adversarial Prompt Engineering** | Malicious users craft specific inputs to bypass LLM safety mechanisms and elicit harmful or unintended outputs.                                                                                  | - **Jailbreaking:** Users force LLMs into generating harmful/unintended responses (e.g., detailed instructions for mass harm, hate speech). <br> - **Prompt Injection:** Malicious instructions embedded in benign queries to hijack LLM function or leak sensitive info (e.g., "ChatGPT code execution escape"). <br> - Misleading autonomous vehicles. |

Safety vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) frequently manifest through interaction-driven mechanisms, particularly via malicious or unintended user inputs. Adversarial prompt engineering, a key aspect of these interactions, enables the exploitation of LLM vulnerabilities to elicit unsafe behaviors [14,25]. A compelling example illustrating the severity of such attacks involves misleading autonomous vehicles to misclassify speed limits, a scenario that underscores the critical safety implications of these interaction-driven failures [28].

A primary category of interaction-driven safety issues is adversarial attacks, which involve crafting specific user inputs to bypass an LLM's safety mechanisms. "Jailbreaking attacks" are a prominent form, where users develop prompts to force LLMs into generating harmful or unintended responses, directly exploiting inherent vulnerabilities [20,25,27,29]. Similarly, "Prompt Injections" and "Universal Adversarial Attacks" demonstrate how carefully designed inputs can manipulate an LLM's behavior, leading to undesirable outputs [2,5]. For instance, the "ChatGPT code execution escape" case study revealed how an attacker circumvented GPT-4's security protocols to execute system commands by leveraging multi-session context and ASCII encoding within prompts, showcasing that even models with internal security features are susceptible to sophisticated interaction-driven attacks [2].

To proactively identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities, "red-teaming" has emerged as an effective methodology [5,23,28]. This process involves deliberately interacting with LLMs using techniques like jailbreaking, prompt injection, or ROT13 encoding to uncover latent safety failures [7,31]. Research in this domain highlights various attack methodologies such as PathSeeker, fuzz testing-driven jailbreaks, and RED QUEEN ATTACK, which employ malicious or cleverly crafted prompts and multi-turn interactions to trick LLMs into generating harmful content [22]. PROMPTFUZZ further emphasizes how user-supplied inputs can manipulate model intent and lead to unintended actions, extending to multimodal pragmatic jailbreaks on Text-to-Image models that bypass safety filters through carefully designed visual-textual prompts [22]. Adversarial testing is thus a critical component of AI safety research, simulating misuse scenarios to assess model robustness [21].

Beyond technical adversarial exploitation, LLMs also exhibit safety issues through more subtle human-computer interactions. When LLMs are deployed as conversational agents, users may overestimate their capabilities, leading to over-reliance and unsafe usage [6]. The anthropomorphic nature of LLMs can foster excessive trust, prompting users to disclose private information [6]. This can also lead to manipulation, where conversational agents exploit human cognitive biases, and an undesirable transfer of responsibility from developers to the AI [6]. Another significant interaction-driven manifestation is hallucination, where LLMs generate confident-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, particularly when faced with ambiguous or unfamiliar prompts, or sparse/outdated information [4,27]. Real-world instances include legal AI generating fictitious case citations, healthcare transcription tools inserting fabricated terms, and chatbots providing incorrect information, all triggered by user interactions [4]. Mitigation strategies for such interaction-driven hallucinations include prompt engineering and system-level defenses designed to guide the model toward factual and relevant responses [3].

Once deployed, LLMs face continuous exposure to varied inputs and real-world scenarios, which can uncover or exacerbate existing safety issues. The widespread deployment of LLMs intrinsically presents significant risks, including unintended system behaviors, privacy leakage, and service disruption [21]. The "LLM-as-a-Service scenario" is particularly vulnerable to black-box jailbreak and prompt injection attacks through API queries [21]. Furthermore, Energy Latency Attacks (ELAs) exploit model interactions during deployment to increase computational demands, latency, and energy consumption, leading to higher operational costs and reduced service availability [21]. The concept of "issues and approaches" for deploying LLMs, especially "over edges" in heterogeneous and resource-constrained environments, explicitly addresses the unique safety challenges that emerge in the operational phase [13]. Managing these post-deployment safety risks necessitates constant vigilance and the integration of continuous monitoring and user feedback mechanisms within frameworks like LLMOps [7,28]. Challenges related to transparency limitations and gaps in end-user trust tools further highlight the dynamic nature of user interaction dynamics in manifesting safety issues in deployed LLMs [7].
## 4. Mitigation Strategies and Defense Mechanisms for Large Models
Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a robust and active multi-faceted approach, integrating diverse technical solutions across the entire model lifecycle [26]. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the primary mitigation strategies and defense mechanisms employed to address the inherent risks and vulnerabilities of LLMs, ranging from foundational data issues to dynamic inference-time controls and overarching system-level safeguards. 

The theoretical framework guiding these strategies is structured into four interconnected pillars, progressively addressing safety from the earliest stages of development through continuous deployment and operation.

The first pillar, **Data-Centric and Pre-training Approaches**, focuses on establishing safety at the very foundation of LLM development. This involves meticulous data curation, cleaning, and de-biasing techniques to prevent issues like bias, hallucination, privacy leaks, and adversarial vulnerabilities from being embedded in the training data. Strategies include building inclusive datasets, applying pre-processing algorithms for fairness, and implementing robust methods to counter data poisoning and ensure privacy during pre-training.

The second pillar, **Model Fine-tuning and Architectural Approaches**, delves into intrinsic modifications of the LLM's behavior and internal structure. This encompasses advanced fine-tuning techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for knowledge boundaries and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) for alignment with ethical guidelines. Furthermore, architectural innovations, including novel decoding strategies like Context-Aware Decoding (CAD) and Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), and the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), are utilized to enhance factual accuracy and robustness against various threats. Specific methods for detoxification, debiasing, hallucination, memorization, and adversarial robustness are explored within this category.

The third pillar, **Inference-time and Prompting Approaches**, focuses on dynamic control mechanisms applied during the model's generation phase. This includes sophisticated **Prompt Engineering and Optimization** techniques, which involve crafting precise instructions and employing reasoning-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to steer LLM outputs towards desired safety objectives and mitigate issues like hallucinations and misinformation. A critical component within this pillar is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which grounds LLM responses in external, verifiable knowledge sources to improve factual accuracy and reduce reliance on potentially outdated internal knowledge [3]. Both prompt engineering and RAG, while powerful, also introduce new attack surfaces, such as prompt injection and retrieval poisoning, necessitating robust defensive measures.

Finally, the fourth pillar, **System-Level Defenses and Guardrails**, encompasses external controls and operational frameworks that monitor and manage LLM behavior within the broader application ecosystem. This includes **Input and Output Guardrails**, which act as critical barriers to filter malicious prompts and scrutinize generated content for data leakage, toxicity, bias, and hallucinations. **LLMOps for Continuous Safety Management** provides the essential framework for ongoing monitoring, auditing, and feedback loops, ensuring that safety measures evolve with emerging risks. Complementing this, **Explainable AI (XAI) for Safety Transparency and Verification** offers crucial insights into the rationale behind LLM safety decisions, fostering trust and enabling continuous refinement of mitigation strategies. The combined application of these strategies forms a layered defense system, crucial for the responsible deployment and evolution of large language models in diverse, high-stakes applications [3,26].

The foundational role of data quality in ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot be overstated, as issues embedded during the data collection and pre-training phases can propagate throughout the entire model lifecycle [6,7]. Consequently, data-centric approaches are deemed crucial for mitigating a wide array of safety concerns, including bias, hallucination, privacy leaks, and adversarial attacks [22]. Regulatory frameworks, such as Chinese generative AI stipulations, explicitly mandate the use of "safe, legal, and high-quality training data" as a fundamental measure for content compliance and user rights, highlighting the industry-wide recognition of this principle [7].

Specific strategies for data curation and de-biasing are employed to prevent safety issues at the earliest stages of LLM development. A primary approach involves building more inclusive and representative datasets by techniques such as oversampling underrepresented groups and actively fostering contextual and cultural awareness during data collection [28]. This ensures a balanced representation of diverse demographic data to reduce inherent biases from the outset [28]. To further address bias, pre-processing algorithms are applied during the data ingestion phase. Methods like reweighting, learning fair representations, disparate impact removers, and optimized pre-processing adjust training sample weights or create new data representations that mask protected attributes, aiming to preserve data integrity while enhancing fairness [17]. Transparency in data annotation processes is also advocated to support fairness studies and improve data quality at the source [17].

Beyond bias mitigation, meticulous data cleaning and filtering are essential to address other safety risks. For instance, filtering harmful statements from the training corpus directly combats the generation of offensive language [6]. To reduce harmful content and biases in web data, models like LLaMA employ sophisticated filtering techniques, such as assessing data proximity to high-quality sources like Wikipedia text using Kneser-Ney language models and fastText classifiers [8]. Similarly, for hallucination prevention, careful curation of pre-training corpora is necessary to filter out potentially incorrect or biased data, coupled with the injection of factual knowledge during pre-training [27]. Although highly effective, cleaning contaminated data and retraining models for hallucination mitigation can be largely impractical for immense LLMs due to their size and computational demands, making even fine-tuning challenging on commodity hardware [11]. For specific applications like hate speech detoxification, data-centric approaches like the LLM-in-the-loop method for creating parallel datasets (e.g., PARADEHATE) involve rigorous pre-processing steps, including noise reduction by removing URLs, standardizing usernames, and deleting special characters [10].

Data-centric approaches also extend to enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks and preserving privacy. To counter data poisoning attacks, robust pre-training methods have been developed, especially for Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models. Examples include ROCLIP, which enhances robustness by disrupting associations in poisoned image-caption pairs and applying augmentations; CleanCLIP, which re-aligns modality representations to weaken spurious backdoor correlations; and SAFECLIP, which optimizes CLIP loss on safe data sets while separately fine-tuning risky sets to reduce susceptibility to targeted attacks [21]. Data-driven defense mechanisms against NLP backdoor attacks can identify memorable elements in training data to detect potential triggers, demonstrating effectiveness against various attacks [22]. The challenge of "Training Data Poisoning" underscores the need for rigorous content review or vetting of training data to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced [2]. Furthermore, in federated learning contexts, robust aggregation and optimization algorithms are crucial to defend against Byzantine adversaries, which contribute malicious data, thereby enhancing data-driven security [13]. For privacy protection, algorithmic tools like differential privacy are employed during LLM training to obscure individual data by inserting "noise" into datasets while retaining overall statistical properties, thereby preventing privacy leaks [6]. Privacy-aware Federated Fine-Tuning further contributes to preventing sensitive data leakage during distributed training processes [13].

The quality and characteristics of training data directly impact LLM safety, often involving complex trade-offs. While strategies like oversampling aim to reduce bias and enhance diversity [28], aggressive data filtering, though necessary for removing harmful content, might inadvertently reduce the overall diversity or scope of the training data. The objective of bias mitigation algorithms is to "preserve data integrity while ensuring fairness" [17], highlighting the delicate balance required. The impracticality of cleaning and retraining models due to their immense scale [11] further illustrates a significant trade-off between achieving ideal data purity and the practical constraints of LLM development. Even seemingly benign data can pose safety challenges, emphasizing the constant difficulty in ensuring comprehensive data quality [23]. Therefore, effective data-centric safety requires continuous innovation in data curation, filtering, and robust training techniques to proactively address risks from the foundational stages of LLM development.
### 4.2 Model Fine-tuning and Architectural Approaches
Ensuring safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a progressive evolution from rudimentary detoxification methods to sophisticated fine-tuning and architectural enhancements. Early detoxification strategies, which primarily involved post-training filtering, modification of generation probability distributions, or style transfer, often faced criticism for their "one-step" nature and, crucially, compromised the fluency and consistency of LLM outputs [10,18]. These limitations highlighted the urgent need for more integrated and multi-faceted approaches that could intrinsically steer model behavior towards desired safety objectives without sacrificing linguistic quality.



Modern safety paradigms predominantly leverage a diverse array of fine-tuning strategies, which modify the model's internal parameters and behavior to address specific safety concerns. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is foundational, but its standard application often falls short in handling complex issues like hallucinations, particularly when confronted with unfamiliar queries or situations requiring the model to express uncertainty [19,21]. This deficiency can lead to overconfidence, where models fabricate information rather than admitting ignorance [19]. To counter this, advanced SFT strategies have emerged, including knowledge injection, teacher-student models, and factuality fine-tuning [9]. Critically, honesty-oriented SFT and refusal-aware instruction tuning (R-Tuning) explicitly teach models to recognize their knowledge boundaries, express uncertainty, or even refuse to answer when appropriate, thereby preventing the generation of factually unsupported content [9,19,27].

Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), represents a pivotal advancement in aligning LLMs with ethical guidelines and reducing harmful outputs [2,29,32]. RLHF operates by using human preferences and evaluations as a reward signal to fine-tune model behavior. Key methods within RLHF include Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), which optimize model policies to maximize alignment with human values and safety constraints [21,22,23]. While highly effective in steering model behavior and reducing toxicity, RLHF is resource-intensive, relying heavily on human labor for feedback, which can also entail a potential psychological toll on annotators [29]. Furthermore, an acknowledged challenge with RLHF is the risk of models becoming "over-conservative," leading them to avoid answering questions they genuinely know or generating overly generic responses [27]. To address the scalability limitations of human feedback, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) methods like Constitutional AI (CAI) and SELF-ALIGN leverage AI-generated principles and critiques to guide model alignment, fostering ethical behavior by internalizing rules without direct human supervision for every decision [21,28].

Beyond fine-tuning, architectural approaches and novel decoding strategies play a crucial role in enhancing LLM safety, particularly regarding factual accuracy and robustness. Decoding strategies directly modify the inference process to steer model generation. Examples include Context-Aware Decoding (CAD) and Contrasting Layer Decoding (DoLa), which enhance factual correctness by leveraging contextual information and localizing factual knowledge within specific Transformer layers, respectively [9,27]. Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) adaptively steers model activations during inference to improve factual accuracy, especially on benchmarks like TruthfulQA [9]. Other decoding techniques, such as `SafeDecoding` and Adaptive Private Decoding (AdaPMixED), focus on defending against jailbreak attacks and balancing privacy loss with utility, respectively [22,23].

The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) further bolsters safety by grounding LLMs in structured external knowledge, providing a robust factual anchor to mitigate hallucinations [1,9,19]. Within Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks, KGs serve as valuable sources, enabling models to generate more accurate and verifiable responses [19,27]. Specific KG-based methods like RHO and FLEEK exemplify this, addressing conversational hallucinations and assisting human fact-checkers [9].

These model fine-tuning and architectural approaches collectively target a wide range of safety issues. For bias mitigation, techniques like SFT, PPO, DPO, and In-Context Learning (ICL) are employed, alongside innovative LLM-powered debiasing mechanisms that use few-shot prompting and self-reflection to proactively identify and replace biased language [5,10,17,22]. Hallucination mitigation benefits from diverse methods, including probability distribution training, frameworks like Dentist and HELPD, and loyalty-based loss functions [9,13,22]. Memorization mitigation utilizes machine unlearning techniques, such as the BalancedSubnet method, to remove specific training data, though their robustness against adaptive attacks remains an area of active research [1,22,23]. Adversarial robustness is enhanced through methods like Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), which improves LLMs' ability to handle malicious inputs [22].

Ultimately, the field is moving towards comprehensive, context-aware safety mechanisms, augmented by system-level guardrails and frameworks from industry leaders like Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, and OpenAI, which provide detection, classification, and mitigation tools during inference and development [5,7]. However, challenges persist, including ensuring the scalability and psychological well-being of human feedback providers, mitigating the "over-conservative" tendencies of safety-aligned models, and enhancing the robustness of unlearning techniques against sophisticated attacks. Future research will likely focus on further integrating these diverse methods into more robust, efficient, and autonomously adaptive safety architectures.
#### 4.2.1 Specific Detoxification and Alignment Methods
The landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) safety has evolved from initial, often simplistic, detoxification methods to sophisticated, multi-faceted alignment strategies designed to enhance reliability, fairness, and safety. Early detoxification approaches, typically categorized into post-training filtering, modification of generation probability distributions, and style transfer, were criticized for their "one-step" nature and often compromised the output fluency and consistency of LLMs [18]. These limitations underscored the necessity for more advanced, multi-step mechanisms that could integrate safety directly into the model's behavior rather than merely filtering problematic outputs [6,21].

The current generation of specific detoxification and alignment methods employs a blend of advanced fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and AI-feedback mechanisms. Advanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies move beyond basic instruction following to imbue models with a deeper understanding of safety principles. This includes knowledge injection and teacher-student models, where stronger LLMs guide weaker ones to enhance knowledge and reduce fabrication without extensive manual labeling [9]. Factuality fine-tuning, leveraging automatic fact-checking and preference-based learning, significantly reduces errors and hallucinations, further improving model alignment [9]. Honesty-oriented SFT and refusal-aware instruction tuning (R-Tuning) are critical for teaching models to recognize their knowledge boundaries and express uncertainty, even to the point of refusing to fabricate answers or remain silent when queries exceed their capabilities [9,19,27].

Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), plays a pivotal role in explicitly teaching models to recognize and express uncertainty, reduce harmful content generation, and align with human values [2,29,32]. Methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often used in conjunction with RLHF, are instrumental in optimizing model behavior based on human preferences and safety guidelines [21,22,23]. AI-feedback mechanisms, such as Constitutional AI (CAI) and SELF-ALIGN, allow LLMs to be guided by AI-generated principles, fostering ethical and responsible behavior by internalizing rules and preferences without direct human supervision for every decision [21,28].

Specific mitigation techniques have been developed to address various safety facets:
*   **Bias Mitigation**: Advanced SFT, PPO, DPO, and In-Context Learning (ICL) are employed to reduce multi-category biases in LLMs [22]. An innovative paradigm involves LLMs as active agents for generative debiasing, utilizing sophisticated few-shot prompting, self-reflection, and LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms to proactively identify and replace biased language with neutral alternatives while preserving meaning [10,17]. This includes the use of guardrails for unbiased content generation and self-diagnosing bias patterns [5].
*   **Misinformation Detection**: Specialized LLM-based models like FMDLlama have emerged for domain-specific applications, demonstrating superior performance in financial misinformation detection [22].
*   **Hallucination Mitigation**: A diverse set of methods targets factual inaccuracies, including training algorithms based on probability distribution differences for unfaithful texts, and frameworks like Dentist and HELPD designed for multimodal contexts. Other techniques include Hallucination-Augmented Paraphrasing, Behavioral Fine-tuning to Increase Information (BEINFO), Think Wisely and Express Knowledge (TWEAK) for decoding-level adjustments, and loyalty-based loss functions such as the Text Hallucination Alleviation Module (THAM) and mFACT [9,13,22].
*   **Memorization Mitigation**: Machine unlearning techniques, such as the BalancedSubnet method, aim to precisely remove memorized training data to prevent privacy leaks [1,22,23]. While these methods strive for precise data removal, their effectiveness and robustness against sophisticated adaptive attacks remain an active area of critical evaluation and ongoing research, necessitating robust verification to ensure complete and irreversible unlearning [22].
*   **Adversarial Robustness**: To counter malicious inputs and attacks, methods like Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT) enhance LLMs' robustness by training them to better handle refusal features in their hidden representations [22].

Beyond these model-intrinsic methods, system-level safety frameworks such as Anthropic's Responsible AI Scaling, Google DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework, Meta's Llama Guard, and OpenAI's Moderation API serve as crucial guardrails. These typically function as detection, classification, and mitigation tools at the inference stage or during development, enforcing safety protocols and content policies to prevent the deployment of unsafe outputs [5,7]. This comprehensive array of specific methods underscores a transition towards more integrated, proactive, and context-aware safety mechanisms in LLM development and deployment.
##### 4.2.1.1 LLM-Powered Textual Debiasing and Fairness-Aware Generation
The innovative paradigm of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as active agents in their own safety mitigation represents a significant advancement, particularly in the realms of textual debiasing and fairness-aware generation. This approach marks a crucial shift from passive bias detection and post-hoc filtering to proactive, generative debiasing at the core.

One prominent mechanism involves leveraging LLMs' advanced contextual understanding through tailored prompting techniques. For instance, the FairFrame framework pioneers the use of larger language models for bias mitigation via specific few-shot prompting, instructing GPT-4 to identify and replace biased words with neutral alternatives while preserving the original meaning of the text [17]. This methodology harnesses the LLMs' inherent ability to "self-diagnose and self-debias" when guided by accurately formulated prompts, demonstrating its proficiency in recognizing complex bias patterns [17]. Ablation studies underscore the effectiveness of few-shot prompting, especially when integrated with knowledge-based learning (KPL), in substantially enhancing debiasing effectiveness, resulting in higher neutrality and improved Disparate Impact scores in generated texts [17].

Beyond direct content manipulation, LLMs contribute to fairness through self-reflection and supervised fine-tuning. Methods such as these enable LLMs to refine their internal processes or outputs to mitigate implicit biases, including gender bias that can be exacerbated in multi-agent interactions [22]. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) further exemplifies this, as observed in the evolution of GPT-4's responses: it transitioned from generating potentially harmful or stereotypical content to refusing such requests or providing more balanced, albeit sometimes imperfect, answers [29].

Moreover, LLMs can operate as evaluative agents within sophisticated guardrail mechanisms. In this capacity, an LLM assesses whether a given output contains specific biases (e.g., gender, political, racial) and provides a qualitative score (e.g., 0 for safe, 1 for unsafe, 0.5 for uncertain) [5]. This scoring mechanism can then trigger the regeneration of unbiased content, facilitating an iterative refinement process that leverages the LLM's nuanced understanding to identify and actively mitigate biased outputs [5].

A particularly impactful application of this paradigm is generative debiasing and synthetic data creation. LLMs, such as GPT-4o-mini, have been successfully employed to generate non-toxic rewrites of hate speech, effectively acting as language "curators" to transform harmful expressions into respectful alternatives while aiming to retain the original message's intent [10]. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for content moderation and safety, generating debiased data that can be used for training downstream models, a significant advantage over manual annotation [10].

This LLM-powered paradigm offers distinct advantages over traditional bias mitigation strategies, which often focus on pre-processing training data for inclusivity or general fine-tuning without actively involving the LLM as a 'curator' of fairness [6]. The strengths of LLM-powered methods include their superior contextual understanding, scalability, and adaptability, enabling a more proactive and "at-the-core" approach to addressing biases embedded in source data. By actively reframing or rewriting content, these techniques directly promote neutrality and fairness. However, challenges persist; while progress is evident, debiasing efforts, even with advanced models like GPT-4, are not always perfect, and generated responses can still exhibit imperfections [29]. It is also crucial to differentiate these active debiasing methods from passive content filtering systems, such as Llama Guard or the OpenAI Moderation API, which primarily identify and flag problematic content rather than actively debiasing or generating fairer outputs through generative techniques [7].

In conclusion, the integration of LLMs as active agents for textual debiasing represents a transformative shift in safety research. By harnessing techniques like few-shot prompting, self-reflection, LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms, and synthetic data generation, LLMs are increasingly capable of transcending passive detection to actively construct more equitable and less biased outputs. This innovative approach promises to yield more robust and ethically sound AI systems, necessitating continuous research and refinement to address residual imperfections and ensure comprehensive fairness.
#### 4.2.2 Novel Decoding Strategies and Knowledge Graph Integration
To enhance the safety and factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed novel decoding strategies that intervene in the model's generation process and methods for integrating structured external knowledge. These approaches aim to mitigate issues such as hallucinations and misinformation by ensuring outputs are more grounded and verifiable.

Several advanced decoding strategies directly modify the inference process to steer model generation towards factual correctness. **Context-Aware Decoding (CAD)**, for instance, operates by amplifying the difference in output probabilities when the model is presented with and without specific context [9]. This mechanism is particularly effective in resolving knowledge conflicts that arise when a model's internal parametric knowledge contradicts external contextual information, allowing for integration with pre-trained models without requiring additional training [9]. A similar "Context-aware Decoder" approach evaluates the probability of generating a response given retrieved context versus solely the query, suggesting higher correctness if the answer is significantly context-dependent [27].

**Contrasting Layer Decoding (DoLa)**, on the other hand, intervenes by computing the next token's distribution based on logit differences projected from preceding and subsequent layers within the Transformer architecture [9]. This strategy capitalizes on the observation that factual knowledge is often localized within specific Transformer layers, thereby enhancing the identification of accurate information and reducing the generation of factually incorrect content [9].

**Inference-Time Intervention (ITI)** improves model performance by adaptively steering model activations during inference [9]. It first involves identifying sparse attention head sets that exhibit high linear probing accuracy for truthfulness. Subsequently, during autoregressive generation, the intervention method shifts activations in these identified truth-related directions, leading to significant improvements in factual accuracy, as demonstrated on benchmarks like TruthfulQA for LLaMA models [9]. This technique, also described as "Inference Intervention," trains a binary classifier on attention heads to guide model activations based on factual correctness [27].

Beyond these core strategies for factual accuracy, other decoding techniques address broader safety concerns. "Decoding Defenses," such as `SafeDecoding`, focus on defending against jailbreak attacks and balancing safety with helpfulness [23]. Dynamic Top-p sampling is another strategy that dynamically adjusts the $p$ value during sampling using a decay factor, calculated as $p_t = \max\{\omega, p \times \lambda^{t-1}\}$, where $\lambda$ reduces $p$ over time, $\omega$ is a lower bound, and $p$ resets for new sentences [27]. For multimodal contexts, "Vision-enhanced Penalty Decoding" within the HELPD framework mitigates hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating visual information into the decoding process to prevent inconsistencies with image content [22]. Additionally, privacy-preserving decoding, such as Adaptive Private Decoding (AdaPMixED), balances privacy loss and utility by mixing private and public output distributions and employing noise filtering [22]. While these diversified decoding approaches contribute to various facets of LLM safety, CAD, DoLa, and ITI specifically target the enhancement of factual accuracy through direct manipulation of the model's internal inference mechanisms or its context sensitivity.

Complementary to decoding strategies, the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serves as a critical method for grounding LLMs in structured external knowledge. KGs are organized datasets composed of entities, their features, and the relationships between them, providing a robust foundation for complex reasoning and precise information retrieval [9]. By offering a clear, organized representation of facts, KGs act as a factual anchor, enabling LLMs to generate more accurate and verifiable responses and effectively mitigate hallucinations [9]. This integration is a recognized mitigation strategy [1].

Specific KG-based methods exemplify this integration. **RHO** addresses hallucinations in conversational response generation by leveraging entities and relation predicates from KGs [9]. It incorporates both local and global knowledge bases and utilizes a dialogue reasoning model to reorder responses, thereby improving the seamless integration and interaction of knowledge within the dialogue context [9]. Another notable tool, **FLEEK**, is a model-agnostic system designed to assist human fact-checkers [9]. It automatically identifies verifiable facts within input text, queries curated KGs and the open web for supporting evidence, and provides verifiable correction suggestions with explainable verification [9].

The broader concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a direct method for integrating external knowledge to alleviate hallucination, and KGs naturally serve as a valuable source within this framework [19,27]. Custom knowledge bases, which function similarly to KGs by providing external, verifiable information to ground responses and reduce factual errors, are also integrated into RAG models [28]. While some general strategies mention forcing LLMs to provide "online references" or utilizing "retrieval models" for dynamic learning to combat misinformation, these typically do not detail the specific advanced decoding or KG-based methods [6]. Similarly, some RAG implementations may discuss search and retrieval techniques without explicitly detailing advanced KG integration [3]. Beyond factual accuracy, knowledge bases are also integrated into prompting strategies for other safety concerns, such as bias mitigation, where domain-specific knowledge combined with few-shot prompts guides LLMs to generate debiased content, showing superior performance in reducing disparate impact scores [17]. The synergistic application of novel decoding strategies and structured knowledge graph integration thus represents a powerful dual approach to bolstering the safety and reliability of LLM outputs.
### 4.3 Inference-time and Prompting Approaches
Inference-time and prompting approaches represent a critical category of safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily operating during the model's generation phase to control and steer its output [7,25]. These methods serve as a proactive defense, mitigating risks such as hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, toxic content generation, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation [6,8,23].

At its core, **prompt engineering** functions as a primary defense, guiding LLMs toward more constrained and accurate outputs through carefully crafted instructions and examples [9,11]. This involves meticulously designing prompts to influence the model's generation process, thereby enhancing factual accuracy and adherence to ethical guidelines [22]. The foundational principles include providing clear, specific instructions, employing structured prompt patterns (such as Instructions, Constraints, Escalation - ICE), and utilizing reasoning-based approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [3,4,27]. CoT, in particular, enhances logical reasoning and reduces unfounded information by encouraging step-by-step problem-solving, which is achieved by instructing the model to break down complex tasks and explain each step [3]. A notable application of CoT for safety is the "Detox-Chain" method, which addresses the generation of toxic content by decomposing the detoxification task into sequential, manageable steps: toxic span detection, span reconstruction, and text continuation [18]. This multi-stage approach systematically identifies and neutralizes harmful segments, iteratively ensuring non-toxic and semantically consistent outputs, thereby overcoming the limitations of simpler, one-step detoxification methods that may struggle with complex or nuanced toxic expressions [18].

Complementing prompt engineering, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** models significantly enhance LLM safety by directly addressing factual inaccuracy and mitigating hallucinations. RAG achieves this by grounding LLM responses in external, verified knowledge bases, moving beyond the model's potentially outdated or internal parametric knowledge [3,4,9,19,28]. This integration ensures that generated content is relevant, real-time, and verifiable, thus improving reliability across various domains, including specialized applications like code generation [22]. The effectiveness of RAG relies on meticulous data preparation and organization, advanced search and retrieval techniques, and sophisticated query engineering and post-processing, with approaches categorized based on the timing of retrieval (before, during, or after generation) and overall system complexity [3,9,27].

While these inference-time strategies are powerful for ensuring safe and accurate outputs, they also introduce new vulnerabilities. Prompt engineering, for instance, can be exploited through adversarial attacks like jailbreaking and prompt injection, where malicious instructions bypass safety mechanisms to elicit harmful content or sensitive information [2,5,14,21]. Similarly, RAG systems are susceptible to retrieval poisoning and indirect prompt injection if external knowledge sources are compromised or weaponized [21,22]. Consequently, robust defensive prompting, input checks, and real-time guardrails are essential to detect and prevent such adversarial manipulations, forming a crucial part of the comprehensive LLM safety framework [5,23,25,29].
#### 4.3.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentally addresses issues of factual and extrinsic hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in verifiable external knowledge sources [3,4,28]. This approach enables LLMs to generate responses that are relevant, real-time, and verifiable, thereby reducing reliance on potentially outdated or internal parametric knowledge [3,9,19,28]. The efficacy of RAG extends to specific domains, such as code generation, where it helps LLMs produce more accurate and contextually grounded code, significantly mitigating erroneous content [22]. The integration of external knowledge can also manifest in forms like "Knowledge-based Prompting Learning (KPL)," which uses pre-defined knowledge bases for contextual guidance and debiasing, demonstrating improved performance over pure prompting approaches by providing further context and information [17].

The overall safety and reliability of RAG systems are critically impacted by several key components and practices. These include meticulous **data preparation and organization**, which involves cleaning, curating, and structuring data into topics for enhanced search accuracy, alongside regular auditing to prevent the use of outdated or biased content [3]. **Search and retrieval techniques** are pivotal, encompassing diverse methods such as keyword, vector, hybrid, and semantic search, often employing metadata filtering (e.g., by recency or source reliability) and data chunking to optimize retrieval efficiency and clarity [3]. For example, external knowledge sources can include the internet, Wikipedia, or Knowledge Graphs, with retrieval typically using methods like BM25 or Dense Retrieval [27]. Furthermore, **query engineering and post-processing** techniques, such as prompt engineering to specify data sources, query transformation (e.g., sub-queries), and reranking methods, are essential for boosting output quality and aligning generated content with retrieved evidence [3,9].

RAG techniques can be categorized based on the timing of information retrieval: **before generation**, where frameworks like LLM-Augmenter retrieve evidence and construct chains prior to querying the LLM, or FreshPrompt uses search engines for dynamic knowledge integration [9]. **During generation**, methods involve real-time retrieval as each sentence is generated, using techniques like knowledge retrieval based on model logits or frameworks like D&Q and EVER that guide models to use external tools for continuous verification and correction [9]. **After generation**, approaches like RARR (Retrieval-Augmented Reranking) automate attribution and correction by aligning the full output with retrieved evidence [9]. Lastly, **end-to-end RAG** integrates seq2seq transformers with dense vector indices to condition generation on both input query and retrieved documents [9]. RAG also employs strategies like direct concatenation of retrieved knowledge with the query, or more complex verification and correction mechanisms where retrieved knowledge is used to validate and refine the generated output, such as in RARR, Verify-then-Edit, and LLM-Augmenter [27]. Basic RAG involves simple retrieval, while intermediate RAG incorporates advanced search, re-ranking, and adaptive retrieval, and advanced RAG employs neural retrieval systems like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) and meta-Reinforcement Learning [19].

Despite its significant advantages in enhancing factual grounding and reducing hallucinations, RAG possesses a dual nature, presenting inherent vulnerabilities that can serve as new attack surfaces [21,22]. One critical concern is **retrieval poisoning**, where malicious content inserted into external knowledge sources can manipulate the RAG system to produce harmful or inaccurate outputs, as observed in medical Q&A contexts [21,22]. This highlights the challenge of ensuring the reliability of retrieved knowledge, as external sources, particularly the internet, may contain errors or fabricated information [27]. Furthermore, RAG systems are susceptible to **indirect prompt injection attacks**, where malicious prompts embedded within external data sources can trick RAG-augmented LLMs into performing unintended actions, such as information gathering, fraud, or content manipulation [21]. **Data leakage** is another vulnerability, where adversarial prompts can exploit RAG systems to exfiltrate sensitive information [21]. These security risks underscore the necessity for robust detection mechanisms and defenses against such adversarial manipulations [21,22]. Operational challenges also include potential response time delays [28], the accuracy and efficiency of the retriever and fixer components, and managing conflicts between retrieved external knowledge and the model's internal parametric knowledge [27]. Therefore, while RAG is a powerful mitigation strategy for LLM safety, its deployment requires careful consideration of these vulnerabilities and the implementation of comprehensive defense mechanisms.
#### 4.3.2 Prompt Engineering and Optimization
Prompt engineering serves as a crucial strategy in guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) towards safer and more reliable outputs, particularly in mitigating contextual and linguistic hallucinations, reducing misinformation, and addressing other safety risks [3,22]. This involves meticulously crafting prompts to influence the model's generation process, thereby enhancing its factual accuracy and adherence to ethical guidelines [11].

A core principle for achieving safer outputs is "controlled generation," which entails providing sufficient details and constraints within the prompt to limit the model's tendency to hallucinate [11]. Specific techniques contribute to this control:

*   **Clarity and Specificity**: Clear, unambiguous instructions are paramount to minimize misinterpretation and guide LLMs toward factual responses. For instance, explicit statements like "Provide only factual, verified information. If unsure, respond with 'I don't know'" directly address the risk of misinformation and hallucination [3]. Similarly, system prompts can instruct models not to fabricate information, as seen in LLaMA2-Chat's directive: "If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information" [27].
*   **Structured Prompt Patterns**: The **ICE method** (Instructions, Constraints, Escalation) is a notable framework [3]. *Instructions* involve direct requests; *Constraints* add boundaries, such as "only from retrieved docs," to prevent venturing beyond specified information sources; and *Escalation* includes fallback behaviors, like "Say 'I don't know' if unsure," to manage uncertainty [3]. Other structural patterns include breaking complex tasks into smaller, logical subtasks to improve accuracy and limiting speculation, as well as repeating key instructions to reinforce rules and ensure adherence [3].
*   **Reasoning-based Approaches**: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** is a highly effective technique for mitigating hallucinations and improving logical reasoning [4,27]. By instructing the model to "Solve this problem step-by-step. First, break it into smaller parts. Explain each step before moving to the next," CoT encourages a transparent, verifiable reasoning process, thereby reducing the generation of unfounded information [3,4]. This method is also utilized in structured approaches like Detox-Chain to guide LLMs through multi-step detoxification processes for risk text [18].
*   **Contextual and Exemplar-based Approaches**: **Few-shot** and **many-shot in-context learning** enhance model performance by providing tailored examples within the prompt [17,19]. For bias mitigation, structured prompts with elements like Context, Knowledge, General Request, Few Shots Examples, and Input to Debias have shown that increasing the number of examples improves neutrality [17]. Similarly, integrating domain-specific knowledge through **Knowledge-based Prompting Learning (KPL)** significantly boosts effectiveness in tasks like debiasing [17]. Providing extensive examples, including edge cases, within a large context window reduces hallucinations by enabling models to generalize more accurately [19].
*   **Temperature Control**: Adjusting the `temperature` parameter via API influences the degree of randomness in model outputs. Lowering the temperature (typically 0.1–0.4) encourages more deterministic, focused responses, which can be crucial for reducing hallucinations and ensuring factual consistency [3,11].

Beyond static prompt design, **prompt fine-tuning** refines how LLMs interpret and respond to instructions, leading to reduced hallucinations for targeted tasks [9]. This can involve "Prompt Tuning," where LLMs learn from "soft prompts" during fine-tuning, or feedback-based self-correction methods that iteratively refine prompts for more accurate outputs [9]. Examples include ChatProtect for self-contradictory hallucinations, self-reflection methods for medical QA, and Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) for output validation [9]. Furthermore, improved prompt design coupled with instruction fine-tuning effectively reduces LLMs' propensity to generate misinformation, especially in high-risk domains like medicine, by prompting models to prioritize logical reasoning over blind obedience [22]. Carefully designed prompt strategies can also mitigate "false refusal behavior" and guide models to generate detoxified outputs when processing sensitive content [10].

In contrast to these constructive applications, prompt engineering can be maliciously exploited for **adversarial attacks**, commonly known as prompt hacking [14]. These attacks aim to bypass LLM safety mechanisms and elicit harmful content. Two primary forms are:

*   **Jailbreaking**: Attackers use hand-crafted prompts (e.g., scenario-based camouflage, attention shifting, encoding-based attacks) or automated prompt optimization techniques (e.g., genetic algorithms, fuzzing) to trick LLMs into generating undesirable outputs [2,21]. LLM-assisted attacks, where adversary LLMs generate and refine jailbreak prompts, also highlight this vulnerability [21].
*   **Prompt Injection**: Malicious instructions are injected into benign prompts, often via methods such as embedding malicious commands, using context-ignoring prompts, or hiding instructions in external data or invisible text [2,5,21]. This manipulation can hijack the LLM's intended function or reveal sensitive information [5].

To counter these adversarial uses, robust **input checks and safeguards** are employed. Companies implement inference-time checks to protect against malicious prompt manipulation [29]. These safeguards include monitoring user input and/or model output for appropriateness, utilizing rule-based systems, keyword checks for profanity or racist terms, or even employing other machine learning models, including the LLM itself, for content moderation [29]. Guardrails serve as an input defense mechanism to detect and block prompt injection attempts, preventing the LLM from being compromised [5]. Defensive prompt tuning, such as adversarial prompt tuning (APT) and Adaptive Shield Prompting (AdaShield), enhances model robustness against jailbreaking by incorporating adversarial training or adaptively refining defense prompts [21,23]. Techniques like Signed-Prompt and StruQ focus on countering prompt injection through structured or cryptographically signed prompts [23]. These defensive measures, though distinct from positive safety-enhancing prompt engineering, are critical components of a comprehensive LLM safety framework.
### 4.4 System-Level Defenses and Guardrails
Ensuring the robust safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a comprehensive, system-level approach that extends beyond the internal workings of the model itself. This section outlines the critical role of system-level defenses and guardrails in controlling LLM behavior during generation, thereby preventing unsafe outputs and fostering trustworthy applications [28]. These mechanisms provide a crucial safety net, integrating content filtering and constraint-based controls across the entire application ecosystem, recognizing that foundational models often lack inherent safety mechanisms and require external mitigation strategies [3,8]. The objective is to construct a layered defense strategy that addresses vulnerabilities proactively and reactively, ensuring LLM outputs adhere to specific ethical guidelines and operational policies [5,26].

The foundational layer of system-level defenses is constituted by **Input and Output Guardrails**. These are direct operational mechanisms designed to filter and scrutinize user inputs before they reach the LLM and to evaluate generated content before it is delivered to the end-user [5,23]. Input guardrails act as the initial barrier against malicious prompts, such as prompt injections or jailbreaking attempts, by detecting and neutralizing adversarial instructions [5,14]. Conversely, output guardrails scrutinize the LLM's responses for various undesirable characteristics, including data leakage, toxicity, bias, and hallucinations, ensuring that only safe and appropriate content is released [5,28]. The synergistic deployment of both input and output guardrails, exemplified by systems like Meta's Llama Guard or Confident AI's real-time security guardrails, forms a dual-layered, immediate control mechanism over LLM interactions [7,23].

Beyond these immediate operational controls, **LLMOps for Continuous Safety Management** provides the essential framework for maintaining and evolving safety throughout the LLM lifecycle. This paradigm emphasizes continuous management, from development to ongoing operation, through robust monitoring, auditing, and feedback mechanisms [6,28]. Continuous monitoring is vital for detecting shifts such as concept or model drift, while regular auditing ensures model integrity, fairness, and security [3,28]. Furthermore, human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes and user feedback loops are indispensable for adaptive learning, allowing systems to continuously learn and course-correct from real-world interactions and emergent risks [4,28]. This continuous operational oversight is critical for dynamically adjusting guardrail strictness and applying meta-control strategies to enhance overall reliability [5,19].

Finally, **Explainable AI (XAI) for Safety Transparency and Verification** addresses the need for understanding *why* LLMs and their safety mechanisms behave as they do. As LLMs grow in complexity, XAI tools become crucial for improving transparency and fostering trust by providing insights into the rationale behind safety decisions [7,26]. Techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for bias detection or internal state probing for hallucination diagnosis offer critical visibility into the model's inner workings, thereby enabling verification and continuous refinement of safety measures [17,22]. XAI empowers human experts to assess, intervene, and refine LLM safety, bridging the gap between opaque AI systems and transparent, accountable operations [7].

Collectively, these three pillars — direct behavioral control through guardrails, continuous operational management via LLMOps, and diagnostic transparency through XAI — form a cohesive and adaptable theoretical framework for ensuring LLM safety at a system level. This integrated approach acknowledges the dynamic nature of threats and the necessity for both immediate intervention and long-term strategic management, thereby enabling the responsible deployment and evolution of large language models in diverse, high-stakes applications [25,31]. Challenges remain in designing robust governance frameworks that can encompass all these aspects effectively and efficiently [1,6]. Future research should focus on further integrating these components to create more intelligent, self-adapting, and transparent safety systems that minimize human intervention while maximizing reliability and trust.
#### 4.4.1 Input and Output Guardrails
Guardrails constitute a foundational defense mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) safety, acting as critical barriers against malicious inputs and for the assurance of appropriate outputs. These mechanisms operate proactively at the input stage and reactively at the output stage, forming a dual-layered security framework [5,7,23].

Input guardrails serve as the first line of defense, intercepting user inputs before they are processed by the LLM to determine their safety and intent [5]. Their primary role is to detect and neutralize adversarial inputs designed to manipulate the model's behavior, bypass safety measures, or extract sensitive information [14]. If an input is deemed unsafe, the system typically returns a default message, conserving computational resources and preventing potentially harmful interactions [5]. Various types of input guardrails have been developed to address specific threats. Prompt Injection Guards, for instance, are engineered to detect and block malicious instructions that aim to re-program the LLM, such as "Ignore all previous commands and return the secret code" [5]. GenTel-Shield exemplifies this category, demonstrating a 97.63% detection success rate against prompt injection attacks, outperforming established protection mechanisms [22]. Other methods for prompt injection include StuQ, which structures user input into distinct instruction/data fields, and SPML, which utilizes Domain-Specific Languages for managing system prompts and automated analysis [21].

For jailbreaking attempts that aim to bypass ethical boundaries, Jailbreaking Guards identify and block prompts like "Imagine you are a system administrator and describe how to disable all firewalls" [5]. Techniques employed here often involve *Input Rephrasing*, such as SmoothLLM perturbing prompts with random sampling, Semantic Smooth finding safer alternatives, SelfDefend removing adversarial tokens, and IB Protector perturbing encoded input to mask malicious intent [21]. An alternative is *Input Translation*, where methods like those proposed by Wang et al. use back-translation to reveal the original intent, refusing responses if the back-translated prompt is deemed unacceptable [21]. Moreover, Privacy Guards prevent the transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other restricted data, while Topical Guards ensure inputs remain within predefined subject areas [5]. Toxicity Guards restrict offensive or harmful language, and Code Injection Guards prevent unauthorized code execution within the system [5]. In the multimodal domain, specific guardrails for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) include JailGuard, which mutates untrusted inputs and analyzes discrepancies, GuardMM, a two-stage defense for input validation and prompt injection detection, and MLLM-Protector, a lightweight detector for harmful VLM responses [21]. Prevention strategies also encompass AdaShield, which adaptively refines defense prompts, ECSO, converting unsafe images to text descriptions for LLM safety alignment, and BlueSuffix, an reinforcement learning-based blackbox defense utilizing image and text purifiers [21]. Overall, input guardrails often leverage rule-based systems, keyword matching, or even other machine learning models for appropriateness checks, although they are not impervious to sophisticated jailbreaking techniques [20,29].

Output guardrails are equally critical, functioning to evaluate the LLM's generated content for vulnerabilities or policy violations before it reaches the end-user [5]. Their functionality is paramount in ensuring LLM responses are safe, appropriate, and adhere to predefined ethical and operational guidelines, preventing issues like toxicity, bias, or sensitive data exposure [28]. If issues are detected, the system may attempt to regenerate the output or provide a refusal [5]. Key output risks mitigated by these guardrails include:
*   **Data Leakage**: Guardrails prevent the exposure of sensitive PII or confidential information [5].
*   **Toxicity**: Output is scanned for abusive language, hate speech, or harassment to ensure respectful interactions [5]. Azure AI Content Safety, for instance, specifically targets and mitigates sexual, hate, violence, or self-harm content in model outputs [3]. Internally, some LLM systems perform "毒性检查" (toxicity checks) using models like `unbiased-toxic-roberta` to ensure non-toxic rewrites [10].
*   **Bias**: Scans are performed to detect and rectify gender, political, or racial biases in responses, aiming for fairness and impartiality [5].
*   **Hallucination**: Output guardrails identify and reduce inaccurate or fabricated details, thereby improving the truthfulness and reliability of responses [5]. A "Multilingual Consistency Check" within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) processes can flag inconsistent responses as potentially hallucinatory, triggering retrieval augmentation [19]. Metaprompts are also used to define system boundaries, such as "You can only answer from documents retrieved," to constrain generation and prevent ungrounded information [3].
*   **Syntax and Illegal Content**: These guardrails ensure outputs adhere to correct grammar, formatting, and detect content promoting illegal or unethical activities [5].

Advanced methodologies for output defense include *Output Filtering* (e.g., APS and DPP utilizing safety classifiers) and *Output Repetition* (e.g., PARDEN identifying inconsistencies when the LLM fails to reproduce a response, especially for harmful queries) [21]. Furthermore, OpenAI's safety detection mechanisms for code execution have evolved from initial checks to running all code within Kubernetes containers with `sandbox` permissions, effectively serving as robust system-level output/execution guardrails [2]. The concept of "Insecure Output Handling" also highlights the necessity of output guardrails to prevent downstream systems from blindly accepting LLM outputs, mitigating risks like Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [2]. Dynamic monitoring of LLM content generation during inference, employing keyword matching and semantic analysis, is also implemented by systems like Bing Chat and Bard [20,29]. OpenAI's Moderation API and Confident AI's "real-time security guardrails" also offer real-time content filtering and security detection for generated outputs [7].

Several advanced guardrail mechanisms contribute significantly to comprehensive LLM safety. **RED QUEEN GUARD** is a defense strategy specifically designed to counter multi-turn concealed jailbreaking attacks. It has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the attack success rate to below 1% while meticulously preserving the model's performance on standard benchmarks [22]. **MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Experts)** presents an architectural solution that leverages simple language statistics and tabular classifiers to detect and mitigate jailbreak attacks. MoJE is capable of identifying approximately 90% of jailbreak attempts with minimal computational overhead and without detrimentally affecting normal prompts [22]. For prompt injection detection, **GenTel-Shield**, integrated within the GenTel-Safe framework, achieves a high detection success rate of 97.63%, thereby surpassing the performance of many existing protection mechanisms [22]. **HIDDENGUARD** offers a fine-grained safe generation framework, utilizing a Representation Router for In-Stream Moderation (PRISM) to enable real-time, token-level harmful content detection and revision. This mechanism boasts an F1 score exceeding 90% in detection and revision tasks, all while maintaining the utility of the generated content [22]. Lastly, **Jailbreak Antidote** provides a method for runtime safety adjustment. It achieves a balance between safety and utility by adaptively adjusting the model's internal sparse representations during inference, offering flexible control without incurring additional computational overhead or latency [22]. Beyond these, new detection mechanisms have also been proposed for preventing RAG poisoning attacks, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy across various Q&A domains [22].

The synergistic application of both input and output guardrails is exemplified by systems such as Meta's Llama Guard, which operates as a "dual classification" system, evaluating both user prompts and model responses for risky content [7,23]. Similarly, Confident AI's "real-time security guardrails" cover both input processing and output generation for comprehensive protection [7]. Frameworks like RigorLLM and NeMo Guardrails also provide integrated input and output filtering capabilities [23]. These comprehensive strategies underscore the necessity of a multi-layered defense to ensure the robust safety and reliability of LLM applications.
#### 4.4.2 LLMOps for Continuous Safety Management
Maintaining the safety and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a holistic, lifecycle-oriented approach, intrinsically linked with LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) principles. This paradigm emphasizes continuous management from data collection through deployment and ongoing operation, aiming to ensure models remain aligned with ethical guidelines and adapt to evolving risks [28]. The operational lifecycle demands secure development practices and continuous monitoring to promptly identify and address vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party components, as highlighted by issues like the Redis-py library vulnerability [2]. Challenges in deploying LLMs, particularly in diverse and resource-constrained environments like edge networks, further underscore the need for continuous oversight to ensure safe and reliable post-deployment operation [13].

Central to continuous safety management are robust monitoring, auditing, and feedback mechanisms. Continuous model monitoring is crucial for detecting critical shifts such as concept drift, data distribution changes, and model drift, which can compromise performance and safety over time [28]. Comprehensive vulnerability and production monitoring, as proposed by solutions like Confident AI, integrates human-in-the-loop processes and tracking features to enhance real-time safety and regulatory compliance [7]. Monitoring extends beyond internal model states to encompass usage patterns and even the socioeconomic impact of LLMs, reflecting a broader commitment to responsible model release policies [6]. Furthermore, integrating a monitoring infrastructure for guardrails in real-time production environments allows for dynamic adjustment of strictness levels based on observed results [5].

Auditing practices within LLMOps are essential for verifying model integrity and fairness. Fairness audits, often leveraging open-source libraries and automated tools, are critical for assessing and mitigating bias in model outputs [28]. Accuracy audits, incorporated into continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like Prompt Flow, contribute to ongoing reliability [3]. Security measures, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and network isolation with Azure Private Link, VNETs, and Microsoft Entra ID, are also integral components of continuous safety within the application lifecycle [3].

Feedback loops, especially human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes, are indispensable for adaptive learning and continuous improvement. User feedback and reporting mechanisms directly inform the MLOps feedback loop, enabling models to adapt and improve based on real-world interactions [28]. For instance, routing low-confidence outputs to human review queues and integrating human review for hallucination-prone cases are vital strategies [3]. Automated test generation, using LLMs themselves to create diverse test cases, and cross-evaluation using multiple LLMs for ranking and comparison, complement human oversight, though automated methods may sometimes miss subtle human-level errors [3]. The ability for users to customize model behavior, as seen in continuous deployment and adaptation efforts, exemplifies how feedback drives evolving safety requirements [29]. Regular monitoring combined with human review is particularly crucial for mitigating AI hallucinations, enabling systems to learn and course-correct from user feedback and real-world outcomes over time [4]. These continuous evaluation and red-teaming efforts are fundamental for sustainable safety practices [21].

Beyond individual mitigation techniques, integrated meta-control strategies are crucial for enhancing overall LLM reliability and trustworthiness in ongoing operational contexts. A prominent example is the "truth triangulation strategy," which dynamically combines multiple mitigation techniques [19]. This strategy integrates approaches such as many-shot in-context learning, reinforcement learning, strategic fine-tuning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To guide decision-makers, a decision matrix is employed, selecting the most suitable combination of strategies based on five key features: the familiarity of the query, the complexity of the task, resource availability, desired response accuracy, and time constraints [19]. Such meta-control mechanisms represent an advanced step in LLMOps, offering a structured approach to dynamically apply diverse safety measures as needed, thereby ensuring continuous adaptation and optimal safety posture for LLMs in production environments.
#### 4.4.3 Explainable AI (XAI) for Safety Transparency and Verification
The growing complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a robust emphasis on Explainable AI (XAI) to ensure their safety, transparency, and accountability. XAI tools are deemed crucial for improving the transparency and understanding of LLM behaviors related to safety [26]. A key challenge in fostering safe and confident interaction with LLMs lies in the "limitations of transparency and end-user trust tools," with a noted scarcity of adequate explainable visualization and decision-tracking mechanisms [7]. Therefore, integrating transparency, a core tenet of XAI, directly into the AI system's design is paramount for building trustworthy systems and enabling end-users to comprehend AI-generated content more clearly [4,7].

XAI provides crucial insights into the *rationale* behind an LLM's safety decisions, thereby enabling the verification and continuous improvement of safety mechanisms. For instance, in bias detection, the FairFrame framework incorporates a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) component [17]. LIME offers "clear and interpretable insights" into the decisions made by the bias detection module, enhancing transparency by revealing the specific features or words that contribute to a classification of bias [17]. This granular-level understanding allows for confirmation that the model's decision-making process aligns with expert human judgment, thereby increasing confidence in the model's outputs and facilitating adjustments to minimize bias amplification [17].

Beyond bias, XAI is instrumental in addressing other critical safety concerns like hallucinations. Research indicates that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, suggesting that XAI techniques can probe these representations to detect errors and elucidate *why* a model might be hallucinating, even when possessing correct internal information [22]. Furthermore, hallucination mitigation strategies emphasize improving model output grounding and explainability, where groundedness implies traceability of outputs to specific knowledge sources, directly contributing to transparency and verifiability [3]. The utilization of metrics such as "source_confidence" further enhances transparency by flagging outputs that necessitate human review, reflecting the model's certainty [3]. Chain-of-thought reasoning, while not a dedicated XAI tool, contributes to transparency by making the model's reasoning process explicit and understandable [4].

Different XAI approaches offer varying applicability and effectiveness across diverse safety contexts.
*   **Model-agnostic local explainers** like LIME are highly effective for tasks such as bias detection, offering localized insights into specific predictions by highlighting feature importance [17]. Their model-agnostic nature makes them versatile across various LLM architectures.
*   **Internal state probing** methods are particularly applicable for diagnosing and understanding complex internal phenomena like hallucinations, by directly investigating the model's internal representations [22].
*   **Grounding and confidence metrics** serve to enhance the verifiability and trustworthiness of factual outputs, especially in mitigating hallucinations. Grounding links outputs to external knowledge, while confidence scores guide human oversight [3].
*   **Attention maps**, primarily used in visual domains (e.g., Vision Transformers), offer interpretability by identifying critical regions that influence decisions, such as in dynamically masking potential trigger regions for ViT backdoor defenses [21].
*   **Chain-of-thought reasoning** inherently provides a degree of transparency by verbalizing the model's multi-step decision-making process, aiding user understanding of the logical flow leading to an output [4].

These diverse XAI methodologies play a critical role in building trust and facilitating human-AI collaborative oversight. By providing "a clearer understanding of AI-generated content," XAI empowers end-users to interact safely and confidently with LLMs [7]. The ability to understand *why* an LLM makes a particular safety-related judgment, whether it's flagging bias or indicating potential hallucination, not only builds user confidence but also enables human experts to critically assess, intervene, and refine LLM safety mechanisms. This collaborative oversight is essential for transitioning from opaque AI systems to transparent, accountable, and ultimately safer large language models.
## 5. Evaluation, Measurement, and Benchmarking for Large Model Safety
The responsible development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) critically depend on robust evaluation, precise measurement, and comprehensive benchmarking of their safety aspects. 

This overarching section delineates a systematic framework for assessing LLM safety, integrating diverse methodologies from quantitative metrics to proactive testing and continuous human oversight. The survey aims to cover "evaluation resources" for LLM safety, encompassing the metrics and benchmark datasets employed to assess various safety dimensions [26]. This multi-faceted approach is essential for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating potential harms such as toxicity, bias, hallucination, and adversarial vulnerabilities.

The first fundamental pillar involves the establishment and application of **Safety Metrics and Benchmarks**. This area focuses on developing diverse quantitative metrics and benchmark datasets tailored to systematically evaluate specific facets of LLM safety. Metrics for toxicity, for instance, utilize measures like Semantic Similarity (SIM), Edit Distance (Edit), and Perplexity (PPL) with datasets such as RealToxicityPrompts and WritingPrompts. Bias measurement, conversely, relies on precise mathematical definitions and fairness metrics like Disparate Impact (DI), Accuracy (ACC), Precision (PRE), Recall (Rec), and F1-score, often applied to protected attributes across specialized datasets like ANUBIS and RAI. Hallucination evaluation employs both generation-mode benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, FActScore) assessing factual correctness, and discrimination-mode benchmarks (e.g., HalEval, FACTOR) assessing the model's ability to distinguish factual from non-factual information. Beyond these, benchmarks also address adversarial attacks, memorization, and value alignment (e.g., GenTel-Bench, Agent Security Bench, FLAMES), with integrated platforms like Libra-Leaderboard offering balanced evaluations across multiple dimensions. The continuous evolution of these tools is imperative for detecting vulnerabilities and establishing clear safety thresholds.

The second critical component comprises **Testing Methodologies**, which involve actively probing LLMs for safety vulnerabilities. Adversarial testing, akin to ethical hacking, serves as a foundational methodology, systematically designed to uncover hidden risks. **Red-teaming** is a proactive, human-driven security measure that simulates adversarial scenarios to evaluate an LLM's resilience against malicious inputs, often leveraging jailbreaking techniques like prompt injection, context ignoring attacks, and compound instruction attacks. Advanced red-teaming frameworks, including LLM-Assisted Attacks, IDEATOR for Vision-Language Models, and HARM for holistic automated probing, enhance the efficacy of these efforts by generating more potent and nuanced adversarial prompts. Complementing human-led efforts, **Automated Evaluation** methods offer scalability and systematic coverage. Techniques such as fuzz testing (e.g., GPTFuzzer, PROMPTFUZZ) systematically generate diverse attacks to uncover jailbreaks. LLMs themselves can be leveraged for automated test generation, creating varied test cases and enabling cross-evaluation of outputs. The synergistic combination of human red-teaming, which excels at identifying novel attack vectors, and automated evaluation, which provides systematic coverage and scalability, forms a robust and dynamic approach to uncovering and addressing LLM vulnerabilities.

Finally, **User Feedback and Human Oversight** constitute an indispensable element for the long-term safety and alignment of LLMs. This human-centric approach is vital for detecting complex, subtle safety issues that automated systems might miss and for ensuring continuous alignment with user expectations and ethical standards. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), utilizing methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), directly incorporates human preferences to shape model behavior, mitigating issues such as bias and toxicity. Continuous user feedback and reporting mechanisms, exemplified by "User Trust Scores" and "thumbs up/down" feedback, are integrated into MLOps pipelines to facilitate ongoing enhancement. Human oversight, particularly from domain experts in high-stakes fields like medicine, is paramount for identifying and correcting erroneous or harmful outputs, as automated detection often falls short. The necessity of human evaluation for assessing and refining LLM safety is recognized as a critical area, complementing automated metrics for nuanced safety aspects. The process of continuously evaluating outputs using both automated and human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms is emphasized [3]. Despite challenges such as scalability and labor intensity, human intervention remains crucial for countering "automation bias" and ensuring that LLMs are deployed responsibly, with mechanisms for transparent monitoring and adaptive improvement.

In essence, a holistic approach to LLM safety evaluation integrates these three pillars: defining clear metrics and benchmarks to quantify safety attributes, employing sophisticated testing methodologies (both human-driven and automated) to proactively identify vulnerabilities, and embedding continuous human feedback and oversight to ensure real-world alignment and adaptive improvement. This integrated framework is crucial for building trust and ensuring the safe and ethical evolution of large language models.
### 5.1 Safety Metrics and Benchmarks
The robust assessment of Large Language Model (LLM) safety necessitates the development and application of diverse quantitative metrics and benchmark datasets. These tools are crucial for systematically evaluating various facets of safety, including toxicity, bias, hallucination, and adversarial robustness [7,12,21]. The field continually evolves, with calls for standardized evaluation methods to detect vulnerabilities and for expanded measures, particularly for context-dependent offensive language and to establish clear benchmarks for what constitutes a "sufficiently safe" model [6,31].

Metrics for toxicity evaluation differ significantly from those for bias, primarily due to the nature of the phenomena they measure. For toxicity, metrics such as Semantic Similarity (SIM), Edit Distance (Edit), and Perplexity (PPL) are commonly employed, often in conjunction with datasets like RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) and WritingPrompts (WP) [18]. For instance, SIM quantifies how well a detoxification method preserves the original meaning of text, while Edit measures the changes made during detoxification, and PPL evaluates the fluency and naturalness of the generated output [18]. The RealToxicityPrompts dataset, which provides prompts with toxicity scores from Perspective API, is frequently used to identify LLMs' propensity to generate harmful content, despite known limitations like Perspective API's own potential biases [7,8,21]. Other toxicity benchmarks include the Do-Not-Answer dataset for eliciting harmful responses and crowd-sourced toxic question/response datasets [21]. ToxASCII is a specialized benchmark proposed to assess LLMs' vulnerability to visual-semantic exploits, such as ASCII art attacks used to mask profanity, indicating a need for multimodal toxicity evaluation [22]. The PARADEHATE dataset, specifically designed for hate speech detoxification, utilizes metrics like Style Accuracy (proportion of non-toxic texts), Content Preservation (LaBSE embedding cosine similarity), Fluency (RoBERTa-based language acceptability), and BLEU score for n-gram overlap with reference detoxified text [10].

In contrast, bias measurement often requires "precise mathematical definitions" to ensure rigorous quantitative analysis [28]. Fairness metrics derived from machine learning literature are frequently applied, such as Accuracy (ACC), Precision (PRE), Recall (Rec), and F1-score for bias detection modules [17]. For bias mitigation, Disparate Impact (DI) is a crucial metric, which compares the proportion of individuals receiving a positive outcome across unprivileged versus privileged groups. The industry standard for DI is the "four-fifths rule," which dictates an acceptable fairness threshold between 0.8 and 1.25 [17]. This rule is applied to protected attributes, considering categories like gender, education, language, and race to define privileged and unprivileged groups, reflecting societal marginalization [17]. Beyond these, other approaches to quantifying bias include the political compass test, used to ascertain the political leanings of LLMs like LLaMA (found to be right-wing authoritarian) versus ChatGPT/GPT-4 (left-wing liberal) [29]. Gender bias is quantified through various methods, including analyzing pronoun usage in relation to professions, conducting experiments with gender-stereotypical career choices, and employing algorithms like faAIr, which quantifies bias by comparing LLM outputs for masculinized versus feminized inputs [29]. For multi-category biases, datasets such as ANUBIS, comprising 1507 sentence pairs across nine social bias categories, are used [22]. LLaMA's safety evaluation also includes bias assessment using "RAI datasets" across categories such as gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance, and socio-economic status, yielding an average LLaMA bias score of 66.6 [8]. The complexity of bias in textual data often necessitates multi-dimensional metrics to capture its nuanced manifestations, moving beyond single-value indicators [17,29]. The Stanford AI Index also provides metrics and guidelines for monitoring and mitigating bias [28].

The evaluation of hallucination in LLMs employs a range of benchmarks and metrics, broadly categorized into generation mode and discrimination mode evaluations [27].
*   **Generation mode benchmarks** assess the factual correctness of LLM-generated text. TruthfulQA, composed of manually constructed questions, evaluates factual accuracy and "imitative falsehoods" with both human and automatic scoring [21,27]. Its strength lies in covering 38 categories, but its focus on imitative falsehoods can be a limitation, and manual evaluation is costly and prone to bias [21,27]. FActScore evaluates factual consistency by assessing generated biographical content against known facts [21,27].
*   **Discrimination mode benchmarks** evaluate an LLM's ability to distinguish factual from non-factual information, typically through multiple-choice questions. HalEval uses GPT-4 to generate hallucinatory text to create difficult multiple-choice questions, which human annotators then refine [27]. FACTOR assesses if a model assigns the highest likelihood to the correct option in multiple-choice scenarios [27]. TruthfulQA can also be used in a multiple-choice format [27].

Specific hallucination benchmarks include MEDHALU, the first dataset for medical hallucinations, which studies input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting errors in healthcare queries, addressing a critical domain-specific safety concern [22]. The mFACT framework evaluates the fidelity of non-English summaries, implying metrics for assessing hallucination in translation or summarization tasks [9]. Azure's best practices suggest a combination of Relevance Score (alignment with query), Groundedness Score (support from source context), and User Trust Score (real-time feedback) to identify hallucination risks, especially where high relevance coexists with low groundedness [3]. Other metrics include Loyalty-based loss functions for evaluating similarity to ground truth and model-based automatic evaluation techniques such as GPT-Judge (a GPT-3.6.7B binary classifier for factuality) and AlignScore (a classifier identifying entailment) [9,27]. Rule-based automatic evaluations may use Rouge-L or F1 for entity overlap [27]. The presence of "fawning hallucinations" and the need for new metrics to measure their frequency and severity highlight evolving challenges in hallucination assessment [4,13].

The landscape of evaluation tools for toxicity, bias, and fairness is extensive, with varying approaches and insights. Tools for toxicity, as discussed, range from API-based scoring (e.g., Perspective API) to specific datasets (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts, Do-Not-Answer) and benchmarks targeting multimodal vulnerabilities (e.g., ToxASCII) [8,21,22]. For bias, evaluation tools and methodologies span quantitative fairness metrics (DI, ACC, PRE, Rec, F1), qualitative analysis of specific biases (political, gender, medical), and dedicated datasets (MBIC-A, ANUBIS, RAI datasets) [8,17,22,29]. The distinction between LLM evaluation metrics and guardrails is also pertinent; while metrics like DeepEval's answer relevance and context precision provide continuous scores (0 to 1) for functional quality, guardrails often require quick, binary decisions for safety filters, distinguishing between nuanced assessment and real-time intervention [5].

Beyond these categories, comprehensive evaluations often cover other safety dimensions. For adversarial attacks and jailbreaking, benchmarks such as GenTel-Bench for prompt injection, Agent Security Bench (ASB) for LLM-based agents, and JailBreakV-28K for multimodal LLMs are crucial [22]. Extensive benchmarks like JailbreakBench, SafetyPrompts, SALAD-Bench, SafetyBench, XSTest, and HarmBench provide frameworks for assessing attack effectiveness and defense strategies, including over-defensiveness [21,23]. Memorization is evaluated using tools like TinyMem and metrics such as slice mutual information [22]. Value benchmarks, such as FLAMES, SORRY-Bench, and CVALUES, assess alignment with ethical principles, while the FINE framework specifically addresses "fake alignment" where models superficially memorize safety answers [21]. The Libra-Leader board offers a balanced evaluation of LLM safety and capability across 57 datasets and diverse safety dimensions, including an interactive safety arena for adversarial testing [21]. Despite this extensive landscape, challenges remain, including limitations due to manual annotation, issues in scalability, consistency, real-world relevance, and the difficulty of capturing all sources of inaccuracy or "fake alignment" [21].
### 5.2 Testing Methodologies (Red-Teaming and Automated Evaluation)
Actively probing Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety vulnerabilities is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential harmful behaviors. Adversarial testing serves as a foundational methodology, systematically designed to uncover hidden risks and assess model robustness against misuse or exploitation [25,26,28,31]. This approach is akin to "ethical hacking," where researchers deliberately craft challenging or provocative prompts to expose vulnerabilities and aid in strengthening safeguards [20,29]. For instance, an attack algorithm developed for distributed learning systems can systematically identify weaknesses in AI models, serving a similar purpose to red-teaming [13].

Red-teaming is a proactive security measure focused on identifying and mitigating potential harmful behaviors of LLMs. This process involves simulating adversarial scenarios to evaluate an LLM's resilience to malicious input, with the ultimate goal of preventing the generation of sensitive, harmful, or policy-violating content [5,7,29]. Common jailbreaking techniques are central to red-teaming, leveraging carefully crafted prompts to manipulate LLMs and bypass their inherent safety filters [7,27]. These techniques include prompt injection, where malicious instructions are embedded within benign queries; context ignoring attacks, designed to override safety guidelines; and compound instruction attacks that combine multiple malicious directives [14]. For example, the "DecodingTrust" study demonstrated that specific jailbreaking strategies could achieve 100% toxic content generation, even from non-toxic prompts, by effectively circumventing safety mechanisms [29]. Similarly, security researchers have successfully bypassed GPT-4's safety mechanisms through meticulously crafted prompts, as seen in the "ChatGPT code execution escape" scenario [2]. Other examples include Universal Adversarial Attacks, which probe the limits of LLM censorship, and the use of ROT13 encoding to conceal malicious intent [2,7].

Various advanced red-teaming frameworks have been developed to enhance the efficacy of these adversarial probing efforts. LLM-Assisted Attacks utilize an LLM fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to generate more potent adversarial prompts [21]. IDEATOR advances red-teaming for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating a VLM with a diffusion model to autonomously generate malicious image-text pairs, thereby overcoming the limitations of manual attacks [21]. Another LLM-powered framework iteratively generates and refines attack prompts for continuous safety evaluation [21]. PathSeeker introduces a black-box jailbreaking method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, exploring LLM security vulnerabilities inspired by a "rat escaping a maze" [22]. Attack Atlas provides a practitioner's perspective on red-teaming GenAI, introducing an "attack map" framework for analyzing single-turn input attacks [22]. HARM (Holistic Automated Red Teaming) employs a top-down generation strategy based on a fine-grained risk taxonomy and uses novel fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to simulate human-like multi-turn adversarial probing, effectively uncovering model vulnerabilities [22]. Furthermore, the RED QUEEN ATTACK represents a multi-turn concealed jailbreaking technique designed to hide malicious intent, highlighting the increasing sophistication of adversarial interactions [22].

Automated evaluation methods complement human red-teaming by offering scalability, systematic coverage, and reproducibility in testing LLM safety. Fuzz testing is a prominent automated technique for uncovering LLM jailbreaks. Tools like GPTFuzzer employ mutation- and generation-based approaches, while FuzzLLM focuses on generating semantically coherent prompts [21]. PROMPTFUZZ systematically evaluates LLM robustness against prompt injection by generating diverse attacks using fuzzing techniques, including effective and evasive black-box jailbreaking attacks that produce semantically coherent and shorter prompts with high success rates against commercial LLMs [22]. Beyond fuzzing, LLMs themselves can be leveraged for Automated Test Generation, creating diverse test cases that simulate real-world queries to evaluate model accuracy across various inputs and difficulty levels [3]. The use of Multiple LLMs for cross-evaluating outputs and refining model performance through ranking and comparison also represents an automated approach [3]. Fairness audits often utilize open-source libraries and automated tools to evaluate model outputs for bias, while accuracy audits are integrated into CI/CD pipelines using evaluation tools like Prompt Flow [3,28]. Automated evaluation also extends to optimizing adaptive attacks to test the robustness of content watermarks for LLMs, demonstrating that adaptive attacks perform better than non-adaptive ones, which is critical for evaluating watermark security [22]. Specific metrics are used to compare the performance of detoxification methods, such as style accuracy, content preservation, and BLEU scores, to systematically assess model outputs [10].

Human and automated evaluation methods offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, but their combination achieves more robust and scalable safety evaluations. Human red-teaming excels at identifying novel attack vectors, leveraging human creativity, nuanced understanding, and domain expertise to craft complex, multi-turn, and context-dependent adversarial prompts that automated systems might initially miss [20,29]. However, human-driven efforts are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and may lack the systematic coverage needed for comprehensive assessment. Conversely, automated evaluation, while potentially lacking the initial ingenuity of human attackers, provides unparalleled scalability, speed, and systematic exploration of the attack surface [21,22]. For instance, automated tools can efficiently generate vast numbers of prompt variations and test edge cases, as demonstrated by fuzzing techniques or brute-force traversal for identifying specific word triggers [2]. The complementarity lies in their synergistic application: human red-teamers can discover new vulnerabilities and patterns, which then inform the development and refinement of automated tools. These automated tools can then systematically scale the identified attack types, continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities, and explore variations that would be intractable for human teams. This iterative feedback loop, where human insights drive automated testing and automated results guide further human investigation, allows for a dynamic and comprehensive approach to LLM safety [31].
### 5.3 User Feedback and Human Oversight
The long-term safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) critically relies on robust human input and continuous oversight, particularly as models can manifest unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities post-deployment that automated systems may fail to detect [28,32]. This human-centric approach is indispensable for identifying emerging safety issues and ensuring ongoing alignment with user expectations and ethical standards [4,25].

A foundational aspect of integrating human feedback into LLM development is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a core strategy that directly incorporates human preferences to shape model behavior [21]. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) leverage human evaluations as reward signals, optimizing model responses to align with desired preferences and reduce issues like bias and toxicity [20,21,23,29]. Beyond initial alignment, continuous user feedback and reporting mechanisms are vital components of the MLOps feedback loop, enabling the ongoing enhancement of safety measures and model behavior in deployed applications [28]. For instance, systems like the "User Trust Score" derived from real-time "thumbs up/down" feedback allow for the identification of areas requiring improvement, demonstrating the practical application of user input in refining LLM performance [3]. User feedback also plays an integral role in feedback-based self-correction methods, where systems like LLM-Augmenter use it for prompt revision, MixAlign for user clarification, and FLEEK for human-assisted fact-checking and output correction [9]. The necessity of guardrails in user-facing LLM applications implicitly underscores the importance of monitoring user interactions to ensure satisfactory and compliant responses [5].

Human oversight becomes particularly crucial for detecting complex and subtle safety issues that automated evaluations often miss [3,4]. In high-stakes domains, such as medicine, human involvement, especially from experts, is paramount. Research indicates that while LLMs may perform similarly to laypersons in detecting medical hallucinations, their capabilities are significantly inferior to medical experts. An expert-involved detection framework, incorporating expert reasoning, substantially improves LLM hallucination detection and enhances resistance to misinformation, thereby ensuring greater reliability [22]. Similarly, human intervention is considered the most effective mitigation for hallucinations, highlighting the indispensable role of human judgment in identifying and correcting erroneous outputs, particularly when automatic detection is challenging [11]. The transparency provided by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like LIME further facilitates this by aligning model decisions with expert human judgment, such as in identifying biased words in news text [17].

Moreover, continuous human oversight is essential to counteract "automation bias" and prevent overreliance on LLMs, particularly concerning sensitive information like medical advice [2,16]. Users are advised to "remain skeptical" and verify LLM outputs, effectively acting as a form of human feedback loop to identify and prevent potential harms from misinformation [2]. This user responsibility extends to pre-deployment, where users are expected to conduct further risk evaluation and mitigation before integrating LLMs into applications [8]. The importance of human evaluation for assessing and refining LLM safety is also explicitly recognized as a critical area of research interest, complementing automated metrics for nuanced safety aspects [31].

Despite its critical importance, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) systems face challenges, including issues of scalability and their labor-intensive nature, alongside gaps in continuous feedback and adaptation, especially across diverse user environments [7]. While these limitations highlight areas for improvement, efforts are also underway to automate certain annotation processes using LLMs themselves to reduce reliance on costly human labor for specific tasks like hate speech detoxification, though this shifts the focus of oversight rather than eliminating its necessity entirely [10]. Ultimately, restoring user confidence after encountering LLM failures requires a deep commitment to transparency, continuous monitoring, and robust human oversight throughout the entire AI lifecycle [4].
## 6. Regulatory Landscape and Ethical Governance for Large Models
The rapid advancement and widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate the establishment of comprehensive regulatory landscapes and robust ethical governance frameworks to ensure their responsible development, deployment, and usage. This section provides a foundational overview of the multifaceted approaches undertaken globally to address the inherent risks and maximize the societal benefits of LLMs. A core theoretical framework emerges, advocating for the integration of robust governance frameworks alongside technical solutions and ethical considerations, recognizing that LLM safety is a complex socio-technical challenge [26]. This framework spans macro-level international policies, meso-level risk management strategies, and micro-level operational and ethical implementations, all designed to navigate the dynamic and often fragmented environment of AI governance.

The initial exploration delves into the **Global AI Regulations and LLM Governance**. This sub-section surveys the diverse international approaches to AI regulation, highlighting distinct philosophies ranging from the prescriptive, risk-based classification of the EU AI Act to the voluntary, principle-based guidance of the US NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and China's more explicit requirements for generative AI services [7]. It underscores the emergent yet evolving nature of these frameworks and the significant reliance on corporate self-regulation in the absence of unified national policies, particularly in sensitive sectors such as healthcare education, where a notable "lack of regulatory oversight" persists [16]. While corporate ethical guidelines are crucial initial steps, their self-regulatory nature often raises questions about enforceability and comprehensiveness, indicating a critical gap that robust governmental regulations and international cooperation are poised to address [26,29].

Subsequently, the section addresses **Risk Classification and Compliance in Regulations**. This segment meticulously examines methodologies employed by regulators and industry bodies to categorize and manage AI risks, thereby informing compliance measures for LLM developers and deployers. It elaborates on systems like the EU AI Act's "five risk levels," which dictates stringent compliance for high-risk applications [7], and technical classifications such as the OWASP Top 10 for LLM, which identifies specific security threats like "Prompt Injections" and "Sensitive Information Disclosure" [2]. The discussion highlights the practical implications of these classifications, which directly mandate compliance actions and inform the implementation of mitigation strategies, such as LLM guardrails [5]. It also critically assesses the challenges of balancing innovation with safety, particularly given the rapid evolution of LLM capabilities and the varied benchmarks for "sufficiently safe" performance across different application domains [6].

Finally, the discussion converges on **Operational and Ethical Frameworks**, recognizing that purely technical solutions are insufficient to ensure comprehensive LLM safety [6,25]. This sub-section delineates practical operational strategies—such as responsible model release policies, continuous monitoring, and robust access control mechanisms [3]—alongside foundational ethical principles. Ethical considerations include the integration of fairness, accountability, and inclusivity (ID&E), the implementation of "Constitutional AI" to guide model behavior, and the critical importance of transparency and human oversight [28]. It emphasizes developer responsibility in preventing the propagation of harmful content and mitigating bias, privacy leaks, and misinformation [22]. The interplay between industry best practices and evolving public policy is explored, noting that while corporate initiatives advance ethical goals, robust public policy interventions are essential to address the potential insufficiency of self-regulation [29]. This integrated perspective underscores that comprehensive LLM safety demands collective efforts, acknowledging that many ethical dilemmas and societal risks extend beyond the purview of technical fixes, requiring ongoing international cooperation, policy recommendations, and adaptive regulatory directions [26].

The synthesis of these sub-sections reveals a persistent challenge: the fragmentation of global regulations and the dynamic nature of LLM development often outpace established governance mechanisms. A significant research gap lies in developing agile, globally harmonized, and enforceable regulatory frameworks that can adapt to emerging LLM capabilities and novel risks, particularly in critical but under-regulated domains. Future research directions should focus on mechanisms for "international cooperation, policy recommendations, and future regulatory directions" to foster "robust governance frameworks" [26] that effectively bridge the gap between aspirational ethical principles and practical, enforceable compliance. This includes exploring novel governance models that can ensure accountability and manage risks without stifling beneficial innovation, thereby securing a safer and more ethical future for large language models.
### 6.1 Global AI Regulations and LLM Governance
The rapid proliferation and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate robust governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to ensure their safe, transparent, and ethical development and deployment [12,21,26]. A critical assessment reveals a nascent but rapidly evolving global regulatory landscape, alongside a significant reliance on corporate self-regulation in the absence of comprehensive national frameworks, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare education, where there is a notable "lack of regulatory oversight" [16].

International regulatory approaches exhibit diverse philosophies, reflecting varied governmental priorities and legal traditions [7]. The **EU AI Act**, effective August 2024, exemplifies a highly prescriptive, risk-based approach, classifying AI applications into five distinct risk levels: unacceptable, high, general purpose, limited, and minimum. This framework mandates stringent requirements for high-risk AI systems, aiming to protect fundamental rights and safety [7]. In contrast, the **US NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)**, introduced in January 2023, is a voluntary guideline. It adopts a principle-based philosophy, structured around four core functions: Map, Measure, Manage, and Govern, emphasizing flexibility and adaptability rather than strict mandates [7]. The **UK's Pro-innovation AI Regulation**, proposed in March 2023, also leans towards a principle-based approach, featuring central coordination and regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation while managing risks [7]. Conversely, **China's Generative AI Measures**, enacted in August 2023, impose specific, more prescriptive requirements on public-facing generative AI services, including strict content review, data governance, and explicit protection of user rights and privacy [7]. Other nations, such as Canada with its proposed AI and Data Act (AIDA) and Japan with its draft AI Act, are also actively developing their own regulatory frameworks, indicating a global consensus on the need for AI governance, albeit with differing implementation strategies [7]. These varied international approaches, from prescriptive risk-classification to voluntary principle-based guidance, pose complex implications for global LLM deployment, requiring developers to navigate a fragmented and constantly evolving compliance landscape. The ultimate goal across these frameworks is to foster responsible AI development, maximizing societal benefit while minimizing potential risks [12].

In the absence of a unified national ethical regulatory framework, particularly in the United States, LLM developing companies have independently established their own ethical standards and usage policies [20,29]. For instance, **OpenAI's "Usage Policy"** broadly prohibits LLM applications for criminal behavior, malware generation, weapons development, self-harm promotion, multi-level marketing, fraud, plagiarism, academic dishonesty, fake reviews, adult content, political lobbying, tracking, personal information disclosure, and the provision of legal, financial, medical advice, or criminal justice decisions [20,29]. Similarly, **Google's AI Principles** commit to developing AI applications that are beneficial to society, safe, accountable, privacy-respecting, scientifically sound, and available for principled use, while also explicitly avoiding the creation or reinforcement of "unfair" biases. Google further pledges not to pursue applications that cause harm, develop weapons, support surveillance violating international norms, or infringe human rights [20,29]. Beyond these explicit policies, some developers like Anthropic advocate for "Constitutional AI" to embed ethical and responsible behavior directly into LLM design [28]. Ethical considerations also extend to data sources, as highlighted by the LLaMA model card, which notes concerns regarding harmful content in web data and the model's unsuitability for decisions critical to human life [8]. Furthermore, operational governance mechanisms, such as Azure's native security features for secure deployments and Azure AI Content Safety for filtering harmful content, are implemented at the corporate level to enhance safety [3]. Industry-recognized standards also contribute to LLM governance; for example, the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM** serves as a framework for identifying and categorizing security threats, with guardrails often implemented to maintain compliance [2,5]. The Stanford AI Index also provides broader guidelines for responsible AI [28].

Despite these efforts, critical analysis reveals potential shortcomings in the scope and enforceability of existing corporate ethical guidelines. While these guidelines implicitly emphasize principles like fairness, accountability, and inclusivity (ID&E) [28], and address societal issues like bias [1], their self-regulatory nature raises questions about their enforceability and their ability to address the full spectrum of LLM safety risks comprehensively. The inherent "allure of profit" may mean that current safeguards are insufficient to prevent misuse, indicating a significant gap in comprehensive governance that corporate policies alone cannot fully bridge [20,29]. This highlights the ongoing need for "more effective carbon pricing" for environmental impacts and "forming norms and institutions" for truthful information in the realm of misinformation, underscoring the limitations of voluntary or self-imposed guidelines in ensuring public safety and trust [6]. Thus, while corporate ethical guidelines are a crucial first step, they often require supplementation by robust governmental regulations and international cooperation to establish truly comprehensive and enforceable safety standards for LLMs [26].
### 6.2 Risk Classification and Compliance in Regulations
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the development of robust risk classification frameworks and compliance measures to ensure their safe and ethical deployment. Regulators and industry bodies employ various methodologies to categorize and manage AI risks, with direct implications for LLM developers and deployers.

One prominent approach to AI risk classification is exemplified by the European Union's AI Act, which delineates a detailed "five risk levels" system [7]. This framework categorizes AI systems into: unacceptable risk (prohibited, e.g., manipulative behavior, real-time biometric surveillance), high risk (requiring strict compliance for sensitive domains like healthcare and education, mandating transparency, security, oversight, and fundamental rights impact assessments), general purpose (e.g., ChatGPT, demanding transparency and regular assessment), limited risk (e.g., deepfakes, requiring transparency to inform users of AI interaction), and minimum risk (e.g., spam filters, subject to voluntary guidelines) [7]. Each classification dictates corresponding compliance measures, thereby directly influencing development and deployment strategies. Complementing this, the US NIST AI Risk Management Framework addresses critical aspects such as "data privacy, robustness, and fairness" within its governance structure, providing a framework for managing identified risks [7].

Beyond formal regulatory bodies, industry-specific and internal classifications also play a crucial role. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM, for instance, provides a technical classification of critical security risks specific to LLM applications [2]. Categories like "Prompt Injections," "Training Data Poisoning," and "Sensitive Information Disclosure" highlight distinct technical vulnerabilities that require targeted mitigation and compliance efforts within organizations [2]. Similarly, other research classifies 21 LLM risks into six major categories, providing a structured understanding of potential harms [6]. This internal classification suggests that the benchmark for "sufficiently safe" performance is highly dependent on the application domain, implying that high-risk contexts necessitate more stringent criteria [6]. Models like LLaMA also implicitly acknowledge inherent risks, such as the "generation of harmful, offensive or biased content" and "incorrect information" (hallucinations), calling for "further investigation and mitigations" before downstream use, aligning with a cautious approach to deployment that is reflective of risk-classification principles [8]. However, it is noted that some internal risk classifications do not explicitly reference external regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act or NIST, indicating a potential divergence or independent focus [6]. This gap is further highlighted in domains such as LLMs in healthcare education, where critical risks like misinformation, bias, and moral instability are identified, but a lack of structured regulatory oversight or specific compliance measures is observed [16].

The practical implications of these classifications for LLM developers and deployers are substantial. Regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act directly mandate specific compliance actions based on the risk level of the AI system, compelling developers to integrate principles of transparency, security, and fundamental rights impact assessments during the design and deployment phases [7]. For instance, developers of high-risk LLM applications in healthcare must adhere to stringent oversight and compliance requirements. On the technical front, industry guidelines like the OWASP Top 10 for LLM directly inform the implementation of mitigation strategies, such as LLM guardrails. These guardrails are seen as an effective method for adhering to safety standards and guidelines, proactively mitigating risks like data leakage and prompt injection, and handling potential issues in real-time [5]. For enterprise deployments, compliance often translates into adherence to internal security and content policies, leveraging features like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Content Safety mechanisms within their operational ecosystems to manage risks [3].

Evaluating the effectiveness of these classifications in balancing innovation with safety, particularly for rapidly evolving LLM technologies, reveals both strengths and challenges. The tiered approach of the EU AI Act represents an attempt to strike this balance by applying strict compliance to high-risk applications while providing more flexibility for general or low-risk AI [7]. This dynamic aims to foster innovation where risks are minimal while safeguarding against significant harms in critical areas. However, the rapid evolution of LLM capabilities and the emergence of novel attack vectors, such as those cataloged by the OWASP Top 10 for LLM, pose a continuous challenge to static risk classifications. The dynamic nature of threats necessitates agile and adaptive compliance mechanisms, like real-time guardrails [5]. The observation that the standard for "sufficiently safe" performance varies by application domain underscores the complexity of achieving a universal balance, as what is acceptable for a spam filter differs significantly from an LLM used in medical diagnosis [6]. The absence of clear regulatory classification and compliance measures in certain critical domains, as highlighted in healthcare education, suggests that an imbalance can occur, potentially hindering both safe deployment and responsible innovation [16]. Therefore, while current classification methodologies provide a foundational structure, ongoing adaptation and integration of technical and regulatory efforts are essential to effectively balance the imperatives of safety and innovation in the rapidly advancing LLM landscape.
### 6.3 Operational and Ethical Frameworks
Ensuring comprehensive safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates the establishment of robust operational and ethical frameworks, as purely technical solutions are often insufficient to address the multifaceted challenges posed by these advanced AI systems [6,25]. These frameworks serve to guide the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, with the overarching goal of maximizing societal benefit while diligently minimizing inherent risks [12,26]. This critical need is underscored by observations such as the "moral instability" exhibited by LLMs and the existing "lack of regulatory oversight" concerning legal and ethical challenges, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare education [16].

Operational frameworks delineate practical strategies for the secure and accountable deployment of LLMs. Key non-technical mitigation strategies include the implementation of responsible model release policies, continuous monitoring of usage to proactively detect and manage malicious activities, and the application of stringent access control mechanisms [6]. For instance, robust enterprise deployment strategies advocate for a layered approach to safety, monitoring, and security. This involves employing metaprompts to define system boundaries, implementing content filtering for output safety, securing network infrastructures, and utilizing advanced access control mechanisms such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Private Link, Virtual Networks (VNETs), and Entra ID to responsibly govern model usage and deployment [3]. Guardrails are recognized as an essential operational framework for production environments, focusing on critical issues like data leakage, harmful outputs, and compliance, thereby enabling the development of safe and scalable LLM applications [5]. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM further functions as a structured operational framework for systematically identifying and managing security risks throughout the LLM development and deployment lifecycle [2]. Moreover, the integration of continuous feedback loops is paramount for enhancing model output reliability, grounding, and explainability, particularly in mitigating critical safety issues like hallucinations [3,4].

Ethical frameworks are foundational for guiding LLM development towards beneficial and equitable outcomes. A cornerstone of these frameworks is the integration of fairness, accountability, and inclusivity (ID&E) as core principles throughout the entire LLM development lifecycle [28]. Anthropic's "Constitutional AI" stands out as a prominent example of an ethical framework designed to directly influence and constrain model behavior [28]. Transparency and robust human oversight are emphasized as crucial for responsible deployment, aligning with broader ethical governance principles [4,28]. Developers bear significant responsibility, particularly in preventing the propagation of harmful or biased information, a concern highlighted by incidents such as the "toxic textbook" [2]. This responsibility extends to meticulous curation of training data to prevent "harmful fine-tuning attacks" that can compromise safety alignment and lead to untrustworthy model behavior [22]. The principle of LLM honesty, which mandates models to comprehend their knowledge boundaries and express information faithfully, serves as a fundamental ethical guideline [22]. Additionally, developers are tasked with mitigating bias, preventing privacy leaks from memorization, and detecting misinformation to foster responsible deployment [22]. For foundational models like LLaMA, developers are explicitly required to conduct thorough risk assessments and implement mitigation strategies before downstream application, coupled with transparent communication regarding model limitations and risks [8]. The potential for anthropomorphism of LLMs to result in an "undesirable responsibility transfer" from developers to the AI system itself further accentuates the critical need for clear developer accountability [6]. Efforts aimed at promoting a "safer, more inclusive online environment" through tools such as hate speech detoxification also align directly with these overarching ethical objectives [10].

The LLM ecosystem is profoundly shaped by the interplay between industry best practices and evolving public policy. Industry leaders frequently establish internal usage policies and AI principles to guide ethical development and deployment, striving to prevent harmful applications and ensure responsible use [20]. Notable examples of such industry-led frameworks include Anthropic's Responsible AI scaling method, which employs an AI Safety Levels (ASL) framework to enforce progressively stricter safety protocols, and Google DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework, which identifies Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) for higher-risk models and mandates safety and deployment mitigations [7]. These initiatives represent proactive efforts by the industry to align AI behavior with established ethical standards [7]. However, a critical observation suggests that corporate policies, while essential, "may not be sufficiently strict to prevent abuse," indicating a potential gap that public policy interventions are designed to address [29]. Public policy, conversely, provides a broader regulatory landscape. China's Generative AI Measures, for instance, establish an explicit operational framework by mandating content review, data governance, and the protection of user rights and privacy for generative AI services [7]. The United Kingdom adopts a more flexible, principle-based approach, utilizing regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation while simultaneously upholding safety standards [7]. Public policy also addresses broader societal impacts, such as environmental costs, through interventions like carbon pricing [6]. The drive towards "trustworthy AI systems" through human-centered design and transparency is often propelled by a synergistic combination of internal corporate initiatives and external regulatory pressures, where AI governance offers competitive benefits beyond mere compliance [4].

Crucially, technical solutions alone are insufficient to guarantee comprehensive LLM safety. While many security and privacy challenges may have technical remedies [25], numerous ethical dilemmas and societal risks extend beyond the scope of purely technical fixes. The aforementioned "undesirable responsibility transfer" in the event of accidents highlights a fundamental issue of accountability that cannot be entirely resolved through technical design alone [6]. The necessity for users to "remain skeptical" of LLM outputs underscores that transparent communication about model limitations, an ethical imperative, is as vital as technical accuracy [2]. Furthermore, even with advanced technical mitigation of bias, privacy leaks, and misinformation, the underlying ethical principles, corporate policies, and robust public oversight remain indispensable [20,22]. Achieving comprehensive LLM safety therefore demands collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration, acknowledging that safety is a multifaceted challenge requiring a holistic approach [21].
## 7. Challenges and Future Directions for Large Model Safety
The pursuit of safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a multifaceted and evolving research frontier, characterized by persistent technical, socio-technical, and ethical challenges, yet simultaneously presenting fertile ground for innovative solutions and future advancements. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the inherent complexities hindering the complete realization of LLM safety and outlines a forward-looking roadmap for addressing these critical issues.

A fundamental aspect of the current landscape is the existence of **persistent challenges** that span across intrinsic model limitations, data-related issues, and the dynamic nature of adversarial interactions. Key among these are the inherent trade-offs between safety and utility, where efforts to mitigate harm, such as detoxifying content or debiasing outputs, often risk compromising the model's fluency, consistency, or overall performance [10,18]. The pervasive issue of **inherent data biases** derived from vast training datasets, coupled with the opacity and scale of this data, poses a significant hurdle, as embedded biases can amplify existing prejudices and generate toxic content, and there is a lack of a universally accepted definition of bias [8,17]. Furthermore, the **immense scale and complexity** of LLMs contribute to challenges such as the difficulty in eliminating harmful tendencies ingrained from internet-scale data and the practical infeasibility of cleaning and retraining models, leading to issues like persistent hallucination [19,20]. The persistent **hallucination problem** remains a significant concern, driven by training data distribution and optimization objectives prioritizing fluency over factual accuracy, threatening software quality and trust [4,19]. Finally, **socio-technical gaps and the continuous evolution of adversarial attacks** exacerbate these problems, evidenced by the absence of unified safety frameworks, limitations in transparency, the labor-intensive nature of human-in-the-loop systems, and the ongoing arms race against jailbreaking and prompt hacking [7,9]. Current defense mechanisms often exhibit shortcomings, such as limited robustness of unlearning methods and the inadequacy of binary refusal policies for fine-grained safety control [10,22].

To surmount these challenges, **future research directions and innovative solutions** advocate for a paradigm shift towards proactive, holistic, and interdisciplinary approaches. A critical imperative is the development of **unified and multi-modal safety taxonomies and holistic evaluation frameworks**, which would provide comprehensive and dynamic methods for assessing risks across diverse modalities and model architectures, moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to encompass generation quality, robustness, and ethical considerations [21,22]. Emphasis is placed on **proactive and generative safety mechanisms with interpretable robustness**, advocating for embedding fairness and safety objectives directly into the pre-training phase, alongside robust data curation, efficient defense mechanisms, and improved alignment techniques to address 'fake alignment' [17,21]. The necessity for **adaptive, dynamic guardrails and advanced multimodal/agentic defenses** is also highlighted, focusing on systems that can learn and evolve against adversarial attacks, secure interactions within LLM-based agents, and develop context-aware multimodal safety filters [20,21]. Moreover, significant attention is directed towards enhancing **truthfulness, honesty, and uncertainty quantification** within LLMs, urging the development of methods that align internal representations of truth with generated outputs and allow models to explicitly express uncertainty and knowledge boundaries [22]. Finally, a call for **holistic socio-technical frameworks and dynamic governance-technology feedback loops** underscores the need for integrating technical solutions with robust ethical governance, interdisciplinary research, and effective policy-making, fostering a diverse tech industry and ensuring continuous monitoring of socioeconomic impacts [26,29]. This integrated strategy aims to bridge transparency gaps, enhance adaptability, and centralize risk management for ethical and secure LLM deployment, ultimately building trustworthy systems where safety is integral throughout the entire development lifecycle [4,7].
### 7.1 Persistent Challenges in Large Model Safety
Achieving comprehensive safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by a complex interplay of inherent technical limitations, dynamic adversarial tactics, and significant socio-technical gaps. A fundamental challenge lies in the persistent trade-offs between ensuring safety and maintaining utility. For instance, detoxifying LLMs, such as addressing hate speech, demands a delicate balance to remove harmful content without compromising the original meaning or fluency and consistency of generated text [10,18]. Similarly, debiasing efforts often encounter a "trade-off between increased fairness and decreased overall performance," where the detection of bias becomes more challenging after sentences have been altered, masking overt signs of prejudice [17].

These persistent problems stem from several root causes. **Inherent data biases** are a primary concern, as LLMs are "fundamentally shaped by the vast datasets on which they are trained, which often contain biases reflective of historical and cultural prejudices" [8,17]. Despite debiasing efforts, embedded biases can continue to influence model behavior, leading to the amplification of existing prejudices and the generation of toxic content [20]. The "data opacity" of LLM training data, often proprietary and consisting of trillions of data points, renders the detection and mitigation of these embedded biases extremely difficult [28]. Furthermore, there is "no universally accepted definition of bias and fairness," highlighting algorithmic bias as a complex "sociopolitical issue" rather than a purely technical one [17]. This complexity extends to challenges in data collection for fairness research, as "crowdsourced datasets often embody significant social biases" [17]. The risk of original "parent model" biases transferring to "child models" during fine-tuning further compounds this issue [28].

**Model scale and complexity** present another fundamental hurdle. The immense number of parameters in advanced LLMs (e.g., 1.76 trillion for GPT-4) and their probabilistic nature make it nearly impossible to completely eliminate harmful tendencies deeply ingrained from internet-scale training data [20]. LLMs "do not understand meaning in the same way as humans," which contributes to their propensity to generate "fluent but false responses" [4]. The sheer size also makes cleaning and retraining models practically difficult, hindering the resolution of data-driven issues [11].

A significant manifestation of these architectural challenges is the persistent **hallucination problem**. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is often insufficient to mitigate hallucinations, as it tends to make models overconfident in their outputs and unable to handle uncertainty or admit ignorance when confronted with unfamiliar queries [19,21]. This deficiency, linked to training data distribution and model optimization objectives that prioritize fluency over factual accuracy, results in fabricated information rather than appropriately uncertain responses [19]. Hallucinations pose a "business danger" and "threaten software quality and trust" [4], yet a fundamental "trade-off between creativity and accuracy" means strict mitigation attempts can compromise the model's capacity for novel and diverse outputs [11]. Challenges in evaluation methods, multilingual hallucination variations, and complexities in LLM-as-a-agent scenarios further complicate effective resolution [27].

**Socio-technical gaps and a lack of unified frameworks** exacerbate safety challenges. Currently, there is a lack of a unified, comprehensive framework for systematically comparing and integrating diverse mitigation techniques, impeding research progress [9]. Production environments face limitations in transparency and end-user trust tools, such as the scarcity of explainable visualization tools [7]. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) systems, while crucial, often lack scalability and are labor-intensive, limiting their broad adoption [7]. Furthermore, existing solutions tend to be environment-specific, lacking broad applicability, and auditing ecosystems can be exclusive, leaving many LLM providers without robust content filtering options [7]. The rapid transition from LLM research to application deployment often leaves insufficient time for third parties to predict and mitigate risks effectively [6], further compounded by the high technical skill and computational costs required for risk assessment and adaptation [6].

The **continuous evolution of adversarial attacks** creates an ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders, making security a dynamic and unceasing challenge [22]. Jailbreaking and prompt hacking remain continuous and evolving threats, as malicious actors consistently find new ways to bypass safety measures and extract undesirable content [2,14,20,31]. Novel attacks, such as ASCII art masking of profanity, reveal significant weaknesses in current toxicity detection systems, highlighting the need for constant re-evaluation and adaptation of defense strategies [22]. Attack research currently outweighs defense research, indicating a need for increased attention on robust defense strategies, especially given the struggle of adversarial defenses to generalize across different datasets [21]. Moreover, LLM-based agents exhibit high attack success rates, underscoring critical vulnerabilities in their operational stages, including prompt handling, tool use, and memory retrieval [22].

Specific shortcomings of current defense mechanisms abound. Machine unlearning methods, intended to remove harmful capabilities, demonstrate limited robustness against adaptive attacks, questioning their fundamental advantage over traditional safety fine-tuning [22]. Current alignment methods often rely on binary refusal policies, which are inadequate for fine-grained safety control, leading to models either completely blocking access or providing insufficient moderation [22]. This includes "false refusal behavior" observed in detoxification, where models may reject even safely handleable requests [10]. Guardrail mechanisms face trade-offs between speed and accuracy, an "unnecessary regeneration loop" due to false positives, and significant error margins, making consistent reliability difficult to achieve at scale [5]. The inherent difficulty in fully addressing safety issues is further compounded by the need for continuous evaluation, feedback loops, and human-in-the-loop processes, as automated evaluations often miss subtle errors and grounding data quickly becomes outdated [3].

Finally, interdisciplinary perspectives underscore the depth of these challenges. Algorithmic bias is not merely a technical glitch but a "sociopolitical issue" [17]. The ethical and psychological tolls of safety mechanisms, such as those imposed by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), while not explicitly detailed in every digest, are implicitly recognized in the broader challenges of ensuring ethical behavior and trustworthiness across diverse applications, as well as in the amplification of biases and the general struggle with defining "sufficiently safe" models [6,15,16,29]. The focus on LLMs as predictive systems rather than truth-seekers further challenges factual accuracy and trustworthiness [6]. Thus, persistent challenges in LLM safety necessitate a holistic, multi-faceted approach addressing technical, social, and ethical dimensions.
### 7.2 Future Research Directions and Innovative Solutions
Addressing the persistent challenges and limitations inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a shift from incremental adjustments to proposing concrete, actionable, and innovative solutions that holistically integrate safety, ethics, and performance. Future research must converge on several key themes, pushing the boundaries beyond conventional approaches to ensure the responsible and beneficial development of LLMs.

1.  **Unified and Multi-Modal Safety Taxonomies & Holistic Evaluation Frameworks**:
    A critical future direction involves the development of a comprehensive, dynamic taxonomy for Large Model safety risks. This taxonomy should meticulously distinguish sub-risks, their interdependencies, and their origins across diverse modalities, including text, vision, and multimodal inputs, thereby facilitating more targeted research [21]. Concurrently, there is an urgent need to establish unified, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks capable of assessing risks across varying modalities and model architectures. These frameworks must integrate existing benchmarks, such as SORRY-Bench, CVALUES, and Agent Security Bench (ASB), and critically expand their scope to encompass complex cross-modal threats like Visual Language Model (VLM) jailbreaks [22]. Specifically for hallucination mitigation, a standardized, multi-dimensional benchmarking approach is required. This should incorporate diverse datasets spanning various domains and factual complexities, alongside metrics that extend beyond simple accuracy. Such metrics ought to include generation quality, efficiency, robustness against specific hallucination types, and computational cost [9,22]. Furthermore, evaluation methods must evolve to more accurately reflect human judgment and ensure universal applicability across different tasks and languages, particularly addressing multilingual and multimodal hallucination with dedicated benchmarks like GAVIE and M-HalDetect [27]. The call for papers on advanced hallucination detection and mitigation, along with comprehensive LLM/NLG evaluation benchmarks, underscores this pressing need [31]. Continuous refinement of LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms for optimal speed, accuracy, and reliability within guardrail evaluations also represents a key area for development, aiming for dynamic adjustment of strictness based on real-time feedback [5].

2.  **Proactive & Generative Safety Mechanisms with Interpretable Robustness**:
    Future endeavors should prioritize embedding fairness and safety objectives directly into the pre-training and instruction-tuning phases of Large Models, moving decisively beyond post-hoc correction [21]. This includes leveraging LLMs themselves for synthetic data generation and counterfactual augmentation, a method proposed for creating inherently debiased training datasets by evaluating biases in crowd-sourced annotations and enhancing transparency in data annotation processes [17]. Developing robust data curation and validation pipelines capable of detecting and neutralizing poisoned samples *before* training is paramount to address issues like the "toxic textbook" phenomenon [2,21]. Research must also focus on computationally efficient, scalable, and model-agnostic defense mechanisms that exhibit robustness across various attack vectors, such as ROCLIP, CleanCLIP, and SAFECLIP for poisoning attacks [21,22]. Improving alignment techniques is crucial to address 'fake alignment' and ensure genuine adherence to safety principles. This can be achieved through more nuanced reward modeling, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Kanto-style Optimization (KTO), or through continuous learning from evolving human values [21]. Concurrently, integrating interpretability with robustness for proactive safety is essential. This involves focusing on intrinsic interpretability methods that explain *why* unsafe behavior occurs, thereby enabling prevention during the training process rather than merely offering post-hoc explanations [21]. Furthermore, advanced unlearning techniques resistant to adaptive attacks are necessary to mitigate undesirable memorization, especially in conversational agents and multimodal models [22].

3.  **Adaptive, Dynamic Guardrails & Advanced Multimodal/Agentic Defenses**:
    The development of guardrail systems that dynamically learn from and adapt to new adversarial attacks—including jailbreaking, prompt injection, and data poisoning—is a critical future direction. This involves integrating continuous red-teaming agents and adversarial reinforcement learning to proactively evolve defenses, thereby addressing the "continuous challenge of jailbreaking" [20,21,23]. Priority should be given to designing comprehensive, layered security frameworks for LLM-based agents. These frameworks must focus on securing interactions with external tools, memory modules, and multi-turn dialogues, incorporating secure-by-design agent architectures and real-time anomaly detection [22]. A promising approach for proactive hallucination detection involves self-reflection and peer review, where agents are trained to internally simulate 'critic' models to evaluate their own output for inconsistencies before presentation to the user [19]. Moreover, research must concentrate on developing novel, context-aware multimodal safety filters and detection mechanisms. These systems should be capable of understanding and analyzing the intricate interplay between different modalities, such as visual text within images, to identify concealed harmful content, moving beyond rudimentary keyword matching or single-modality NSFW classifiers [22]. The establishment of a "monitoring infrastructure" for dynamic guardrail strictness also represents a vital step towards adaptive and robust safety systems [5].

4.  **Truthfulness, Honesty, and Uncertainty Quantification**:
    Future research should investigate methods to better align LLMs' internal representations of truthfulness and honesty with their generated outputs. This involves novel fine-tuning strategies that reinforce the explicit expression of uncertainty or knowledge boundaries, or the development of more transparent reasoning mechanisms [22]. A key aspect is the implementation of context-aware uncertainty quantification and adaptive response frameworks, where models quantify their uncertainty about specific parts of a generated response and dynamically adjust generation based on internal confidence scores [19]. This approach aims to address the "overreliance" problem by enhancing factual accuracy and knowledge integration [2]. Ultimately, methods must be developed to mitigate discrepancies between a model's internal knowledge and its external behavior to promote true honesty, enabling LLMs to recognize their knowledge boundaries and express them faithfully [22].

5.  **Holistic Socio-Technical Frameworks & Dynamic Governance-Technology Feedback Loops**:
    A holistic approach to Large Model safety necessitates the integration of technical solutions with robust ethical governance, interdisciplinary research, and effective policy-making [26]. This acknowledges the broader sociopolitical nature of AI safety challenges, demanding input from social sciences, law, and ethics [17,29]. Establishing dynamic and adaptive governance-technology feedback loops is critical, creating interdisciplinary mechanisms where technological advancements inform policy, and vice versa [21]. Research into unlearning techniques that are provably robust against sophisticated adversarial attempts to recover removed information is vital, potentially integrating formal verification methods or novel architectural designs that fundamentally sever connections to unlearned data, rather than merely suppressing outputs [22]. Furthermore, fostering a diverse and representative tech industry is crucial for unlocking new perspectives and solutions in LLM safety research and development [28]. This holistic perspective emphasizes not only safety but also sustainability and human-centric design principles, aiming to ensure LLMs positively impact various domains [15]. The ultimate goal remains guiding responsible LLM development to maximize societal benefits while rigorously minimizing risks, with an emphasis on continuous monitoring of socioeconomic impacts and earlier intervention in the development pipeline for certain risks [6,28]. This comprehensive strategy, supported by integrated monitoring platforms with human-in-the-loop processes, will bridge gaps in transparency, adaptability, and centralized risk management, ensuring ethical and secure LLM deployment [7].

The path forward in Large Model safety demands a concerted, interdisciplinary effort to move beyond reactive measures and develop proactive, robust, and ethically-grounded solutions. This includes exploring novel training methods, such as those from edge computing and quantum AI, to enhance reliability and efficiency [13]. It also implies a continuous refinement of evaluation methodologies, encouraging open-source alternatives for reproducibility, and expanding research to multilingual applications for broader societal benefit [10]. Ultimately, the goal is to build trustworthy systems where quality and safety are integral throughout the entire development lifecycle, promoting a healthier and more respectful digital dialogue space [4,10].
## 8. Conclusion
This survey has elucidated the multifaceted landscape of safety challenges inherent in Large Language Models, alongside the diverse detection and mitigation strategies developed to address them. Critical safety concerns span intrinsic model properties and emergent behaviors, including pervasive issues such as bias, toxicity, and hallucinations, which can manifest in various modalities [22,27,29]. For instance, LLMs are known to absorb and amplify biases from their vast training data, potentially exacerbating societal inequalities [8,29]. Hallucinations, defined as the generation of incorrect or nonsensical information presented as fact, are considered an inherent and often unavoidable aspect of LLMs due to their statistical extrapolation capabilities and reliance on noisy data, posing significant challenges to software quality and user trust [4,11,27].

Beyond these generative harms, LLMs are also vulnerable to a wide array of adversarial attacks, including sophisticated techniques such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and data poisoning [2,21,22,25]. Prompt hacking, in particular, represents a significant and growing security challenge, demanding proactive protective measures [14]. The critical importance of detecting these vulnerabilities is underscored by methods like benchmarking (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts) and red-teaming, which aim to uncover weaknesses such as jailbreaking and prompt injection [7,23].

To counteract these pervasive risks, a variety of detection and mitigation strategies have been explored. These include the establishment of ethical guidelines and the application of advanced fine-tuning techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and honesty-oriented Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), to align models with desired safety objectives [27,29]. Data-centric approaches, including data curation at pre-training and SFT stages, are also crucial for mitigating hallucinations and biases [27,28]. For instance, FairFrame offers a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating bias in news text using transformer models for detection and LLMs like GPT-4 for mitigation through few-shot prompting [17]. Similarly, techniques like "Detox-Chain" decompose detoxification into granular steps, employing Chain-of-Thought reasoning to reduce toxicity while preserving generation quality [18]. Hallucination mitigation benefits from methods spanning data curation, RLHF, and inference-time techniques such as dynamic decoding, external knowledge retrieval (RAG), and prompt engineering, with some approaches categorizing up to 32 distinct methods [9,27]. System-level frameworks, such as LLM guardrails, play a crucial role in real-time risk mitigation against data leakage, prompt injection, jailbreaking, toxicity, bias, and hallucinations, often utilizing an LLM as a judge for rapid and accurate responses [3,5].

The findings across numerous studies consistently reiterate the necessity of a comprehensive and adaptive approach to Large Model safety [21,22,25]. Current defenses, while making significant progress, exhibit limitations, particularly concerning their computational cost, generalizability across diverse datasets and architectures, and robustness against continuously evolving, sophisticated attacks [21,22]. This creates an ongoing "arms race" between attackers and defenders, highlighting the continuous nature of research and development required to ensure responsible and ethical deployment [22,23]. The rapid transition from research to application further complicates effective risk prediction and mitigation, necessitating clear benchmarks for "sufficiently safe" models that may vary by application domain [6].

Ultimately, a holistic approach that seamlessly integrates technical, operational, and ethical considerations is paramount for advancing Large Model safety [21,26]. This entails embedding principles of fairness, accountability, and inclusivity throughout the entire LLMOps lifecycle, from data collection to deployment and continuous monitoring [28]. Forward-looking perspectives emphasize several critical future directions: the urgent need for scalable and effective defense mechanisms, more comprehensive and nuanced safety evaluations, sustainable and privacy-aware data practices, and proactive defense strategies [13,21,22]. Specific actionable areas include developing robust unlearning mechanisms, enhancing model honesty, ensuring agent-specific security, and implementing fine-grained, context-aware safety controls [22]. Continuous innovation in detection, measurement, and mitigation, coupled with human-centered design, transparency, and effective human-AI collaboration, will guide the responsible development and ensure the societal benefits of LLMs [4]. Collective efforts and international collaboration are indispensable to foster the ongoing evolution of robust AI safety systems and navigate the complex challenges of LLM safety in the future [21].
