# 0. A Survey on 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving

## 1. Introduction
Accurate 3D perception is indispensable for the reliable operation of autonomous vehicles, serving as the foundational element for critical functionalities such as path planning, motion prediction, and collision avoidance [1,3,4,12,20,25,26,29]. While traditional 2D object detection provides valuable contextual information, its inherent limitations, particularly the lack of spatial dimensions and direct depth information, render it insufficient for robust 3D localization and environmental understanding in dynamic driving scenarios [1,3,22,26]. In contrast, 3D object detection directly operates within a real-world 3D coordinate system, providing geometric information crucial for measuring distances and enabling informed decision-making for safe navigation [3].



**Comparison of Sensor Modalities for 3D Object Detection**

| Sensor   | Advantages                                                | Disadvantages                                                    | Key Use                                    |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Camera**   | Cost-effective, rich texture and semantic information.  | Lack direct depth, susceptible to illumination/weather, occlusion. | Object classification, contextual understanding. |
| **LiDAR**    | Highly accurate 3D point cloud data, precise geometry, robust to ambient light. | Sparse point clouds, costly, affected by severe weather (less than cameras). | Accurate 3D localization, depth information. |
| **Radar**    | Robust in adverse weather (rain, fog, snow), direct velocity measurements. | Lower spatial resolution, sparser data, challenging for precise object shapes. | Robust detection in challenging weather, velocity estimation. |

Various sensors are employed to acquire 3D information, each possessing distinct advantages and disadvantages. Cameras, for instance, are cost-effective and provide rich texture and semantic information [8,22,23]. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection faces significant challenges due to the absence of direct depth information, susceptibility to varying illumination conditions (e.g., low-light environments), scale variation, and occlusion, which can severely impact performance [1,23,26,32]. LiDAR sensors, conversely, excel at providing highly accurate, high-resolution 3D point cloud data, delivering precise geometric and depth information regardless of ambient lighting conditions and ensuring privacy-preserving data acquisition [8,18,19,22]. Despite these strengths, LiDAR point clouds can suffer from sparsity, posing challenges for robust perception [7]. Radar, though not extensively detailed in the provided digests, typically offers robust performance in adverse weather conditions and direct velocity measurements, albeit with lower spatial resolution compared to LiDAR and cameras.

Given the inherent limitations of individual sensors, multi-modal fusion, particularly the combination of LiDAR and cameras, has emerged as a predominant paradigm for achieving robust and high-quality 3D object detection [2,8,21,24,25]. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of different modalities: cameras provide rich semantic and texture details, while LiDAR offers precise geometric and depth cues. However, effective multi-modal fusion is a non-trivial task, fraught with challenges such as spatial misalignment due to sensor perturbations or calibration errors, and the potential for mutual interference or noise if data streams are mishandled [2,7,24,25].

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving, encompassing a broad spectrum of techniques and offering unique perspectives on the field [1,3,11,16,20,21,22,24]. We systematically review advancements across various sensor modalities, including camera-only methods (such as the FCOS3D model, which addresses monocular challenges by transforming 3D targets to the image domain and decoupling attributes [23,26]), LiDAR-only approaches (emphasizing the importance of voxel, pillar, projection, and graph representations [35]), and cutting-edge multi-modal fusion techniques [2,21,24]. A significant contribution of this survey lies in its emphasis on robustness, analyzing the resilience of 3D object detection methods against environmental variations, noise, and weather changes, thereby steering future research toward more practical and real-world applicable solutions [11]. Furthermore, we offer an in-depth comparison of specific fusion theories and methods, examine their fusion stages, inputs, and granularities [2,21,24], and discuss the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and robustness in different algorithmic designs, including one-stage and two-stage detection methods [11,16,28]. This survey synthesizes the latest research progress, covering emerging methodologies such as adaptive and semi/weakly supervised 3D object detection, alongside traditional and end-to-end driving systems [3,20]. By providing a structured classification, performance analysis, and identification of key features for future detector design, this work aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions of 3D object detection in autonomous driving [3,16,22].

Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to precisely perceive their dynamic surroundings and execute subsequent tasks such as tracking, prediction, and path planning with safety and reliability [29]. This critical perception capability involves identifying and localizing various traffic participants, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, within complex three-dimensional scenes [3,9,16,30]. The fundamental objective is to predict an object's precise position, dimensions, and orientation in 3D space from diverse sensory inputs [1,22]. Mathematically, this can be expressed as determining a 3D bounding box \(B\) from sensory input \(I\) using a detector \(F\) with learnable parameters \(\theta\), represented as \(B = F(I; \theta)\) [3,30].

The primary method for representing detected 3D objects in autonomous driving is the 3D bounding box, typically defined as an oriented cuboid in 3D space [1,22,30]. The most prevalent parameterization for a 3D bounding box is the seven-parameter method, which encapsulates an object's location, size, and orientation with a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DoF) representation: \((x, y, z)\) for the center coordinates, \((l, w, h)\) for length, width, and height, and \(\theta\) for the yaw rotation angle [2,3,26,27]. This robust encoding facilitates precise localization and dimensioning for navigation. Other encoding techniques are also employed, each with specific advantages for different applications and data modalities. These include simpler axis-aligned 3D center offsets that lack orientation information, comprehensive 8-corner point representations that can introduce redundancy, and hybrid 4-corner points with 2 heights offering a balance of compactness and 3D detail [16,26]. For monocular 3D detection, a 2.5D center with 3D size is used, leveraging camera intrinsics to recover 3D information [23]. The choice of encoding strategy significantly influences network architecture and efficiency, with efforts directed at pruning redundant degrees of freedom for lightweight models [28].

The robust perception required for autonomous driving heavily relies on integrating data from various sensor modalities, primarily cameras, LiDAR, and radar. Each sensor offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, necessitating multi-modal fusion approaches to mitigate individual limitations [24,30,34].

*   **Cameras** are cost-effective and provide rich color, texture, and semantic information crucial for object classification and contextual understanding [1,3,8,9,21,26]. However, they inherently lack accurate direct depth information, posing a significant challenge for 3D localization, and their performance severely degrades under varying illumination and adverse weather conditions like heavy rain or fog [1,2,3,21,26]. Monocular cameras, while simple, struggle with depth accuracy [20,23], whereas stereo and multi-view setups improve depth estimation but introduce increased costs and calibration complexities [2,20].

*   **LiDAR** sensors are active systems providing highly accurate distance measurements and robust 3D geometric information by measuring Time-of-Flight (ToF) of laser beams [1,3,6,8,22]. This direct depth acquisition significantly enhances 3D detection efficiency and accuracy, especially in extreme lighting conditions where optical sensors may fail [2,20,21,33]. LiDAR output consists of sparse point clouds, where each point contains 3D coordinates \((x, y, z)\) and intensity \(r\) [3,22]. Despite their high accuracy, LiDAR systems are often costly and can be affected by severe weather, though generally less so than cameras [1,20].

*   **Radar** sensors, particularly millimeter-wave radar, offer a cost-effective solution with superior resilience to adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, fog, and snow [2,21]. However, radar typically provides lower resolution and sparser data compared to cameras and LiDAR, making it challenging to infer precise object shapes [2,21].

The complementary nature of these sensors drives the development of multi-modal fusion strategies, which combine data streams to overcome individual sensor limitations and enhance overall detection accuracy and robustness [6,7,9,13,20,24]. Nevertheless, fusing heterogeneous data, which varies in resolution, coordinate systems, and noise properties, presents substantial challenges related to alignment, calibration, synchronization, and the significant computational complexity required for real-time applications [13,20,24,25].

Given the unstructured and non-fixed size nature of raw point clouds from LiDAR, their encoding into more structured forms is essential for efficient processing by 3D object detectors [22]. The choice of 3D data representation significantly impacts computational complexity, memory requirements, potential information loss, and ultimately, algorithm performance. Common 3D data representations include:

*   **Point-based representations** directly process raw point cloud data, preserving maximal information but incurring high computational costs due to the irregular and unordered nature of point clouds [2,10].
*   **Voxel-based representations** discretize 3D space into a grid of voxels, aggregating features from contained points. This allows for efficient parallel processing and is suitable for feature extraction with sparse convolutions, but can lead to information loss through quantization and increased costs for higher resolution [2,6,10].
*   **Pillar-based representations** simplify voxelization into vertical columns, enabling efficient derivation of Bird's Eye View (BEV) features [33].
*   **Projection-based representations** transform 3D point clouds into 2D formats, like Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, Range View (RV), or pseudo-images. BEV is particularly effective for unifying multi-modal features and aligning LiDAR and camera data in a common spatial domain [2,8,9,13,25,28,33]. While these projections leverage the efficiency of 2D processing, they inherently risk information loss, especially critical depth information.

Preprocessing techniques are vital for preparing raw sensor data, including denoising, downsampling, ground removal, data cleaning, normalization, and resizing, to enhance data quality and suitability for detection models [7,30,34]. Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, rotation, scaling, and translation, are also indispensable for improving model robustness and generalization, particularly in handling varied object orientations and sizes, thereby preventing overfitting and enhancing overall reliability in autonomous driving applications [2,34].

Numerous survey papers have reviewed various aspects of 3D object detection, contributing to the understanding of the field's fundamental concepts, data representations, and deep learning applications [3,16,20,26,27,30,33]. Some surveys focus specifically on LiDAR-based methods [33], while others provide overviews of multi-modal approaches [2,21]. However, existing literature often either provides a general overview of 3D object detection or focuses on multi-modal detection without fully covering the latest datasets, algorithms, and specific challenges pertinent to autonomous driving [1]. While significant progress has been made through deep learning and computer vision, achieving high accuracy and maintaining robustness in complex and variable autonomous driving scenarios, especially with single-sensor algorithms, remains a considerable challenge [21]. This survey aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of 3D object detection in autonomous driving, focusing on recent advancements, practical challenges, and future directions within this specialized domain.
### 2.1 Problem Formulation and 3D Bounding Box Encoding
The fundamental objective of 3D object detection in autonomous driving is to accurately identify and localize objects within a complex 3D scene [3,16,22]. This task extends beyond merely recognizing object categories; it demands precise spatial information, typically predicting the object's position, dimensions, and orientation in three-dimensional space [1,22]. Common object categories relevant to autonomous driving scenarios include vehicles (e.g., cars), pedestrians, and cyclists [9,16,30].

The 3D object detection problem can be generally formulated as predicting the properties of 3D objects from sensory input. Mathematically, this can be expressed as 
$$
B = F(I; \theta),
$$ 
where \(I\) represents the sensory input (e.g., point clouds, images, or sensor fusion data), \(\theta\) denotes learnable parameters of the detector, and \(F\) is the 3D object detector that outputs the predicted 3D object \(B\) [3,30]. The input modality significantly influences the detection methodology, encompassing approaches based on LiDAR point clouds, camera images (including monocular setups), or the fusion of multiple sensor data [18,21,23,30].

A critical aspect of 3D object detection is the representation, or encoding, of 3D bounding boxes, which are typically defined as oriented cuboids in 3D space [1,22,30]. The most prevalent parameterization for a 3D bounding box is the seven-parameter method, which encapsulates the object's location, size, and orientation with a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DoF) representation. This method typically defines a bounding box \(B_i\) by its center coordinates \((x_i, y_i, z_i)\), its physical dimensions (length \(l_i\), width \(w_i\), height \(h_i\)), and its yaw rotation angle \(\theta_i\) [2,3,26,27]. This 7-parameter encoding allows for precise localization and dimensioning, crucial for autonomous navigation. For instance, the regression targets for this encoding can be defined relative to an anchor box \(a\) as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta x &= \frac{x_{gt} - x_a}{d_a}, \\
\Delta y &= \frac{y_{gt} - y_a}{d_a}, \\
\Delta z &= \frac{z_{gt} - z_a}{d_a}, \\
\Delta w &= \log\left(\frac{w_{gt}}{w_a}\right), \\
\Delta l &= \log\left(\frac{l_{gt}}{l_a}\right), \\
\Delta h &= \log\left(\frac{h_{gt}}{h_a}\right), \\
\Delta \theta &= \theta_{gt} - \theta_a,
\end{aligned}
$$

where \(d_a\) is the diagonal of the anchor box [26]. This formulation explicitly captures the relative positional and orientational offsets.

Beyond the widely adopted seven-parameter method, other encoding techniques are employed to represent 3D bounding boxes, each with specific advantages depending on the application and data modality [30]. These include:
* **Axis-aligned 3D center offset**: This simpler representation focuses on the center coordinates and dimensions but does not explicitly encode orientation, making it less suitable for objects with significant yaw angles [16,26].
* **8-corner points**: This method defines the bounding box by the coordinates of its eight vertices. While comprehensive, it introduces higher dimensionality and potential redundancy in the representation [16,26].
* **4-corner points with 2 heights**: This approach combines a 2D bounding box (defined by four corner points on the ground plane) with two height values (top and bottom), offering a balance between compactness and 3D information [16,26].

In specific contexts, such as monocular 3D object detection, a 2.5D center representation combined with 3D size is utilized, where the 2.5D center can be transformed back to 3D space using camera intrinsic matrices [23]. Furthermore, some systems leverage simplified assumptions: for objects on the ground, it is often sufficient to predict only the yaw angle, reducing the complexity of orientation estimation [22]. This adaptability in 3D bounding box representation allows for tailored solutions that consider specific sensor inputs and computational constraints, even enabling the bounding box to adjust its size and position to represent the full extent of partially obscured or truncated targets [22]. The choice of encoding strategy also influences network architecture and efficiency, with novel strategies focusing on pruning redundant degrees of freedom to create lightweight models [28]. Overall, the definition of the 3D object detection task centers on robustly identifying and localizing traffic participants, primarily through the precise parameterization of their 3D bounding boxes [3,16,22,26].
### 2.2 Sensor Modalities
The accurate and robust perception of a vehicle's surroundings is paramount for autonomous driving, necessitating the integration of various sensor modalities. The primary sensors employed for 3D object detection include cameras, LiDAR, and radar, each presenting unique trade-offs in terms of cost, range, accuracy, and robustness to diverse environmental conditions [24,30,34]. Understanding their individual properties and the challenges inherent in their fusion is critical for developing effective perception systems.

Cameras: Camera sensors are widely adopted due to their low cost and ability to capture rich color and texture information, providing semantic context about the scene [1,3,8,9,26]. They generate dense data, which is beneficial for detailed scene understanding [21]. However, cameras inherently lack direct and accurate depth information, posing a significant challenge for 3D object detection, as they cannot directly acquire the 3D structure of the scene [1,3,26]. Furthermore, camera performance is highly susceptible to variations in illumination and adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or direct sunlight, which can severely degrade detection accuracy [1,2,21].

Different camera configurations present varying capabilities. Monocular camera systems, though cost-effective and simple to implement, struggle considerably with depth information regression, leading to reduced 3D accuracy [2,20,23]. Stereo camera setups enhance depth estimation precision and accuracy by utilizing parallax between two images, but they entail increased deployment costs due to calibration requirements and remain vulnerable to environmental factors [2,20]. Multi-view camera systems offer a broader panoramic perspective, improving overall safety and practicality; however, the absence of direct constraints between cameras can render the depth estimation problem ill-posed [20].

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): LiDAR sensors are active sensors that provide highly accurate distance measurements and robust 3D geometric information by emitting laser beams and measuring their Time-of-Flight (ToF) [1,3,6,8,22]. This direct acquisition of depth information significantly enhances detection efficiency and accuracy, particularly compared to image-centric methods [20,33]. LiDAR is especially robust in extreme lighting conditions, performing reliably when optical sensors might fail [2,21]. The output of a LiDAR sensor is a point cloud, 
$$
I_{point} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3},
$$ 
where each point typically comprises 3D coordinates $(x, y, z)$ and laser reflection intensity $r$ [3,22]. Some advanced LiDARs may also include an elongation value corresponding to the laser pulse width [22]. The 3D coordinates can be calculated as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= d \cdot \cos \varphi \cdot \cos \omega, \\
y &= d \cdot \cos \varphi \cdot \sin \omega, \\
z &= d \cdot \sin \varphi,
\end{aligned}
$$
where $d$ is the measured distance, $\varphi$ is the yaw angle around the Z-axis, and $\omega$ is the fixed pitch angle of each laser emitter [22]. Mechanical LiDAR, commonly found in autonomous driving systems, rotates to achieve a 360-degree field of view and typically features multiple laser emitters (e.g., 16, 32, or 64 channels), determining its vertical resolution and density [2,22]. Despite their high accuracy, LiDAR systems are associated with substantial hardware costs and can be affected by severe weather conditions, though generally less so than cameras [1,20]. Additionally, LiDAR point clouds are inherently sparse compared to camera images [21].

Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging): Millimeter-wave radar sensors offer a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR and demonstrate superior resilience to adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and snow, making them highly reliable in challenging environments [2,21]. However, radar typically provides lower resolution data compared to cameras and LiDAR, and it faces significant challenges in directly inferring precise object shapes [2]. Similar to LiDAR, radar produces sparse data points, which can limit the granularity of detection [21].

Comparison and Complementarity: The distinct properties of cameras, LiDAR, and radar lead to their natural complementarity in autonomous driving. Cameras contribute rich semantic information and texture crucial for object classification and context understanding [6,8,9], while LiDAR provides unparalleled accuracy in 3D spatial and depth information [6,8,9]. Radar fills critical gaps by offering robust performance under environmental conditions where optical sensors may struggle [2,21]. This inherent synergy motivates the development of multi-modal fusion approaches, which aim to combine data from multiple sensors to mitigate individual limitations and enhance the overall accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection systems [6,7,9,13,20,24].

Challenges in Data Fusion: Despite the clear benefits, fusing data from disparate sensor modalities presents substantial challenges. Each sensor type — camera, LiDAR, and radar — possesses unique characteristics, data distributions, and ranging/imaging mechanisms [13,24]. Effectively aligning these heterogeneous data streams, which often differ in resolution, coordinate systems, and noise properties, demands sophisticated calibration and synchronization techniques [25]. Furthermore, the simultaneous processing of multiple data modalities significantly increases computational complexity and time, a critical constraint for real-time autonomous driving applications [20]. Addressing these complexities is fundamental for developing robust and efficient multi-modal 3D object detection systems [11].
### 2.3 3D Data Representation and Preprocessing
The inherent unstructured and non-fixed size characteristics of raw point clouds necessitate their encoding into more compact and structured forms for efficient processing by 3D object detectors [22]. LiDAR point clouds, a primary data source in autonomous driving, inherently provide precise spatial coordinates and reflection intensity values, which are crucial for distinguishing objects based on their material properties and geometric locations [16,21]. The choice of 3D data representation significantly impacts computational complexity, memory requirements, potential information loss, and ultimately, the performance of 3D object detection algorithms.

Common 3D data representations include point-based, voxel-based, pillar-based, projection-based (e.g., Bird's Eye View (BEV), Range View (RV), pseudo-images), and graph-based methods [22,30,33]. Recent advancements also feature dual expression categories, integrating two distinct forms of representation within a single detector architecture [22].

•  Point-based representations directly process the raw point cloud data [2]. Their primary advantage lies in preserving the maximum amount of original information, as no spatial discretization or projection is applied that might lead to data loss. However, this fidelity comes at the cost of higher computational requirements due to the irregular and unordered nature of point clouds, making direct processing challenging for standard convolutional neural networks [2].

•  Voxel-based representations discretize the 3D space into a grid of voxels [2]. Each voxel can then encode aggregated features from the points it contains, typically through 3D sparse convolution [6]. These representations offer efficient parallel processing capabilities, making them suitable as fusion inputs in multi-modal systems [2]. Voxel-based methods are particularly advantageous for feature extraction within structured grids [10], and they facilitate the use of sparse CNNs or transformers for detection [2]. Nevertheless, voxelization can lead to information loss due to quantization and aggregation within each voxel, and an increase in resolution to mitigate this loss can significantly escalate computational costs and memory requirements [2].

•  Pillar-based representations can be viewed as a 2D variant of voxelization, where the 3D space is divided into vertical columns or pillars. This approach simplifies the 3D structure into a pseudo-2D representation, from which BEV feature maps can be efficiently derived [33].

•  Projection-based representations transform 3D point clouds into 2D formats, typically for processing with efficient 2D convolutional networks.
   -  Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a widely adopted projection, summarizing point statistics within pixel regions to generate a top-down 2D representation [33]. BEV is particularly effective for unifying multi-modality features, enabling the alignment and fusion of LiDAR and camera data in a common spatial domain [8,13,25]. While BEV enhances geometric completeness, challenges such as feature misalignment between sensors and the suppression of unreliable features require careful handling [7,25].
   -  Range View (RV) projections convert 3D point clouds into 2D images based on range and angular coordinates [2].
   -  2D Pseudo-images involve transforming 3D point clouds into a 2D image-like format while striving to retain critical spatial features [28]. While these projections leverage the efficiency of 2D processing, they inherently risk information loss, particularly depth information, which is critical for 3D object detection.

The choice of data representation directly influences the design and performance of 3D object detection algorithms. For instance, voxel-based methods often employ sparse convolutional networks, while BEV representations are central to multi-modal fusion architectures, aligning camera and LiDAR features [13,25]. Additionally, methods exist that project 2D object detection results from images into the point cloud domain to generate 3D frustum data with semantic information, further refining the data for processing [9].

Preprocessing techniques are crucial for preparing raw sensor data for training and evaluation, enhancing the quality and suitability of the data for detection models [34]. Common preprocessing steps include denoising to remove spurious points, downsampling to reduce data density and computational load, ground removal to isolate objects of interest from the road surface, voxelization, and various projection methods [30]. Other vital steps encompass data cleaning, normalization, and resizing [34]. The advantages of these techniques include reducing noise, managing data volume, and transforming data into a format amenable to specific network architectures. For example, denoising modules can suppress unreliable features, improving the robustness of detection [7]. However, these techniques can introduce disadvantages such as information loss during downsampling or projection, and computational overhead associated with complex transformations.

Data augmentation techniques are indispensable for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of 3D object detection models, ensuring they perform reliably across diverse scenarios [34]. Standard augmentation methods include random cropping, flipping, rotation, scaling, and translation [2,34]. By exposing the model to varied transformations of the input data, data augmentation helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to detect objects under different orientations, sizes, and positions, thereby enhancing overall detection performance and reliability in autonomous driving applications.
## 3. Deep Learning-Based 3D Object Detection Methods
Deep learning has revolutionized 3D object detection in autonomous driving, moving beyond traditional methods to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and robustness. This transformation is driven by sophisticated algorithmic approaches tailored to various sensor modalities, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. The field is characterized by a continuous evolution, marked by shifts in architectural paradigms, such as the transition from anchor-based to anchor-free methods, and the pervasive integration of advanced deep learning techniques [22,26]. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the principal categories of deep learning-based 3D object detection, critically evaluating their contributions, inherent limitations, and potential avenues for improvement, thereby establishing a foundational framework for understanding the current landscape of autonomous driving perception [3,4,30].



![Categorization of Deep Learning-Based 3D Object Detection Methods](https://modelbest-prod.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/SurveyGo/picture/367FzO6INTrDz2MyCPgax_/home/surveygo/data/requests/13520/survey/imgs/Categorization%20of%20Deep%20Learning-Based%203D%20Object%20Detection%20Methods.png)

The diverse landscape of 3D object detection methods can be primarily categorized based on the sensor input they utilize: LiDAR-based, camera-based, and multi-modal fusion approaches [1,4,11,27]. Each category addresses the complex task of perceiving the 3D environment by leveraging the unique characteristics of its respective sensor data, while simultaneously grappling with inherent challenges.

LiDAR-Based Methods excel in providing precise 3D geometric and depth information, crucial for accurate object localization and sizing in various conditions [3]. However, the sparse and irregular nature of LiDAR point clouds necessitates specialized data representations and processing techniques, leading to diverse methodological sub-categories such as point-based, voxel-based, pillar-based, BEV-based, projection-based, and graph-based approaches [33,35]. These approaches represent different strategies to balance precision, computational efficiency, and memory consumption, which are vital for real-time applications [35].

Conversely, Camera-Based Methods offer rich textural and semantic context, which is indispensable for object classification and contextual understanding. Nevertheless, they inherently struggle with direct depth estimation from 2D images, posing a significant ill-posed problem compounded by issues like scale variation and occlusion [2]. Consequently, camera-based approaches, including monocular and stereo setups, focus on sophisticated techniques for depth inference and the reconstruction of 3D properties from 2D visual cues [26]. Despite advancements, they often face limitations in accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging environmental conditions, compared to LiDAR-based systems [2].

Recognizing the complementary nature of these sensors, Multi-Modal Fusion Methods aim to integrate data from disparate sources, predominantly LiDAR and cameras, to achieve a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the environment [9,24]. By compensating for individual sensor weaknesses, fusion strategies, broadly classified as early, intermediate (deep), or late fusion, seek to enhance overall detection performance and reliability [2,21]. The effectiveness of these methods critically hinges on addressing challenges such as sensor calibration, data association, and managing diverse data formats and densities [4,25].

Across all sensor modalities, algorithmic development trends are evident. The shift from anchor-based methods, which rely on predefined bounding box priors, to anchor-free approaches, which directly regress object properties, reflects an ongoing effort to simplify detection pipelines and improve computational efficiency [16,23]. Similarly, the adoption of one-stage detectors, exemplified by models like FCOS3D and 6DoF-3D, aims for real-time performance by directly predicting target attributes, contrasting with two-stage methods that involve intermediate proposal generation [16,23,28]. The pervasive use of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms, underpins the feature extraction and decision-making processes across all categories [7,9,34]. The following sub-sections will delve into the specific architectures, mechanisms, and advancements within each of these fundamental categories of deep learning-based 3D object detection methods.
### 3.1 LiDAR-Based Methods
LiDAR-based methods are pivotal in autonomous driving for their ability to provide precise 3D geometric information, which is crucial for robust 3D object detection. The inherent sparsity and irregular structure of LiDAR point clouds present unique challenges, necessitating diverse methodological approaches for effective processing and analysis [3,30,33]. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the primary categories of LiDAR-based 3D object detection techniques, analyzing their foundational principles, advantages, disadvantages, and evolutionary trajectories [27,35].

These methods can be broadly categorized based on how they represent and process the 3D point cloud data: point-based, voxel-based, pillar-based, BEV-based, projection-based, and graph-based approaches [30,33,35]. Each paradigm offers distinct trade-offs between precision, computational efficiency, and memory consumption, which are critical considerations for real-time autonomous driving applications.

**Point-Based Methods** directly process raw point clouds, preserving fine-grained spatial information without quantization errors. Pioneering works like PointNet and PointNet++ established the groundwork for handling unordered point data, with subsequent advancements focusing on improving local context capture and computational efficiency through refined sampling strategies like Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) and optimized feature learning modules [4,5,19,22]. However, their computational complexity, especially for dense point clouds, remains a significant challenge.

**Voxel-Based Methods** transform irregular point clouds into structured 3D grids (voxels), enabling the application of conventional 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [10,22,35]. Key to their efficiency is the adoption of sparse convolutions, which mitigate the computational burden associated with processing largely empty voxel grids, as exemplified by models like SECOND and Voxel R-CNN [6,10]. The choice of voxel size significantly impacts both accuracy and computational cost, reflecting a critical architectural decision.

**Pillar-Based Methods** can be viewed as a specialized form of voxelization, collapsing 3D voxels into 2D vertical pillars. This transformation allows for efficient processing using 2D CNNs on Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, offering a notable balance between performance and computational speed. PointPillars is a prominent example, showcasing the efficacy of this approach for real-time applications [22].

**BEV-Based Methods** focus on transforming 3D point clouds into a top-down 2D perspective. This representation simplifies spatial relationships, reduces occlusion effects, and facilitates the use of highly optimized 2D detection networks [4,30]. While effective for capturing planar relationships, maintaining critical 3D information, particularly height data, requires careful feature encoding.

**Projection-Based Methods** generalize the concept of transforming 3D point clouds into dense 2D image-like representations, including both Front View (FV) and Bird's Eye View (BEV) projections [22,35]. These methods leverage the efficiency of 2D CNNs, with the challenge lying in effectively encoding rich 3D spatial information into the 2D projected channels to minimize information loss.

**Graph-Based Methods** represent point clouds as graphs, where points are nodes and spatial proximity defines edges. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are then employed for feature learning, directly modeling the relationships between points. While theoretically powerful for capturing irregular structures, these methods often face high computational costs associated with graph construction and processing, particularly for high-density point clouds [30,35].

The evolution of these LiDAR-based methods consistently reflects efforts to enhance accuracy, improve real-time performance, and ensure robustness in diverse autonomous driving scenarios [35]. Performance comparisons across benchmark datasets like KITTI and nuScenes frequently evaluate models based on metrics such as detection accuracy (e.g., Average Precision), inference speed, and stability under varying environmental conditions. Subsequent sections will delve into each of these categories, detailing their specific architectures, underlying mechanisms, and advancements.
#### 3.1.1 Point-Based Methods
Point-based methods constitute a fundamental category of 3D object detection techniques that directly process raw point cloud data [3,19,30,33]. A primary advantage of this approach is its ability to directly capture local structures and fine-grained patterns, thereby retaining the original geometry of the raw point cloud without the need for quantization [1]. This contrasts with methods that convert point clouds into structured representations, such as voxels or pseudo-images, which may lose precise spatial information [10,18,28].

The pioneering works in this domain, PointNet and PointNet++, introduced architectures capable of processing unordered point data. PointNet directly utilizes raw point clouds to learn 3D representations for tasks such as classification and segmentation, circumventing the need for voxelization [4]. Its strength lies in handling the unordered nature of point clouds through the use of symmetric functions—typically max-pooling. Building upon PointNet, PointNet++ addresses its limitation in capturing local contextual information by recursively aggregating point clouds in a hierarchical manner [4]. It achieves this through multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), which allow it to capture fine-grained local structures more effectively [4]. The Set Abstraction (SA) layers in PointNet++ are central to its feature learning, aggregating features within local neighborhoods using techniques such as ball query to collect context points within a predefined radius, followed by aggregation using multilayer perceptrons and max-pooling [3,27].

Despite their strengths, point-based methods face inherent challenges, notably the unstructured and unordered nature of point cloud data as well as computational complexity [19,30]. A significant challenge lies in efficiently processing the large volume of points while maintaining high resolution and detail. This often necessitates point cloud sampling to reduce the data to a more manageable, fixed size (e.g., from approximately 120,000 points to 16,000 points) [22].

Different sampling techniques significantly impact performance. Two prominent methods are random sampling and Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) [22,33]. Random Uniform Sampling (RUS) is computationally efficient since it involves randomly drawing points until the desired number N is selected [22,33]. However, it introduces bias: points in denser regions of the point cloud are sampled more frequently than those in sparse areas, leading to a non-uniform representation [22,33]. In contrast, FPS mitigates this bias by iteratively selecting points based on the furthest distance criterion [22]. In each iteration, FPS calculates distances from all unselected points to the last selected point and chooses the point with the maximum distance. This results in a more representative and uniform downsampled point cloud [22,33]. Nevertheless, FPS is sequential and computationally more intensive, which can increase the overall computational cost [22,33]. FPS is a widely adopted sampling strategy, for instance, in PointNet++ and advanced architectures such as 3DSSD, which employs FPS with both Euclidean and feature metrics [3,4]. Other sampling methods, such as segmentation-based or voxel-based approaches, are also employed [27].

Beyond sampling, point-based methods employ various feature learning modules. While PointNet++'s Set Abstraction layers are common, advancements include graph operators (e.g., Point-GNN, which treats points as graph vertices [4]), attentional operators, and Transformers [27,33]. However, some methods, such as Point-GNN, suffer from long graph construction and inference times and are sensitive to deformation, requiring mechanisms like auto-registration [4]. Similarly, multi-stage architectures like PointRCNN—which leverage PointNet-like blocks to learn semantic cues and generate 3D proposals—have been noted for their slow inference times [1,4]. Ongoing research, exemplified by works like "Not All Points Are Equal: Learning Highly Efficient Point-based Detectors for 3D LiDAR Point Clouds," continues to address these computational limitations and improve the efficiency of point-based detectors [5]. Furthermore, challenges such as determining the optimal number of input points and choosing the appropriate sampling radius remain critical considerations in the design of effective point-based detection systems [27].
#### 3.1.2 Voxel-Based Methods
Voxel-based methods represent a prominent category in 3D object detection for autonomous driving, primarily addressing the irregular nature of LiDAR point clouds by converting them into a structured format [3,22,33,35]. This process, known as voxelization, discretizes the 3D space occupied by the point cloud into a regular grid of volumetric cells, or voxels [3,22]. Each voxel is then characterized by its presence of points, categorized as either a zero voxel (no points) or a non-zero voxel (at least one point) [22]. The spatial partitioning can follow Cartesian coordinate systems, resulting in cuboidal voxels, or cylindrical coordinate systems (also known as Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) voxelization), yielding cylindrical slices [22].

Several strategies exist for point-to-voxel assignment and feature encoding. Fixed voxelization involves grouping points into predefined voxels and then sampling a fixed number of points within each voxel, or a fixed number of non-zero voxels from the total, potentially leading to information loss due to subsampling or padding [4,22]. For instance, if a voxel contains more points than its predefined limit, some points may be discarded [4]. Conversely, dynamic voxelization avoids sampling, dynamically adjusting buffer sizes to accommodate all points and voxels, thus preserving information [22]. This approach establishes a two-way mapping between points and voxels, defined by the functions 
  $F_V(p_i)$ for assigning points to voxels and 
  $F_P(v_j)$ for collecting points within a voxel [22]. Hybrid scale voxelization also dynamically adapts the number of voxels and points per voxel, but primarily focuses on point-to-voxel mapping without establishing a bidirectional relationship, often determining point-to-voxel assignment based on an index 
  $c_i = \operatorname{argmin}_s(p_i \in V_j^s)$ [22]. Once points are assigned, voxel features are extracted. Simple methods include binary occupancy coding or statistical approaches (e.g., average 3D coordinates, reflection intensity) [22]. More advanced techniques employ deep learning models, such as PointNet-based architectures, exemplified by the Voxel Feature Encoding (VFE) module, to learn rich feature representations for each voxel [4,22].

Following voxelization, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are applied to extract features from these structured voxel grids [3,22,33,35]. Models like VoxelNet rasterize point clouds into volumetric dense grids for 3D CNN processing [1,4,30]. Voxel R-CNN, for instance, utilizes a 3D backbone network to process these voxel grids and employs a voxel RoI pooling mechanism to extract features directly from voxel features for refinement [10].

The choice of voxel size significantly impacts both detection accuracy and computational cost [27]. A finer voxel resolution (smaller voxel size) allows for more precise localization and preserves more fine-grained details from the original point cloud, potentially leading to higher accuracy [4]. However, this comes at the expense of increased memory consumption and higher computational complexity, as 3D CNNs typically exhibit cubic complexity with respect to the spatial dimensions of the input volume [4]. Conversely, coarser voxel resolutions reduce computational burden but may lead to significant information loss due to discretization, potentially hindering the detection of small objects or fine-grained features [4]. This discretization can also lead to non-deterministic results or discarding points when the number of points exceeds a predefined limit within a voxel [4].

To mitigate the computational challenges associated with dense 3D convolutions on highly sparse voxel grids, sparse convolutional networks have been widely adopted [30,33]. Since most voxels in a typical LiDAR point cloud are empty (zero voxels), traditional dense convolutions would perform unnecessary computations on these empty regions, squandering computational resources [1]. Sparse convolutions, as leveraged by methods like SECOND, strategically skip computations for zero voxels, significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference speed [1,4]. This efficiency enables real-time processing speeds, crucial for autonomous driving applications. Other models, such as HVNet, also employ multi-scale voxelization and feature extraction, coupled with feature fusion and dynamic feature projection to enhance performance and achieve real-time speeds [4,5]. While pillar-based methods like PointPillars also discretize point clouds, they specifically encode points into vertical pillars and use 2D CNNs—a variant that trades some 3D information for speed [4]. The effective utilization of sparse convolutions represents a critical advancement, enabling voxel-based methods to achieve a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency for 3D object detection [6].
#### 3.1.3 Pillar-Based Methods
Pillar-based methods represent a significant category within 3D object detection for autonomous driving, primarily designed to balance effectiveness with computational efficiency and memory usage [3,33]. These methods organize raw LiDAR point clouds into vertical pillars, effectively elongating voxels along the Z-axis into two-dimensional (2D) structures [1,30,33,35]. Unlike traditional voxelization that divides space into fixed 3D cells, pillar-based approaches disregard division along the Z-axis, creating "unbound voxels" that are essentially fixed-size columns in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane [22]. This transformation effectively converts the sparse 3D point cloud into a multi-channel BEV image representation [22].

The process typically involves assigning points to these pillars, which can be achieved through various methods such as fixed voxelization, dynamic voxelization, or hybrid scale voxelization [22]. Following point assignment, feature extraction is performed for each pillar. This often employs deep learning modules, exemplified by the PointPillars framework, which utilizes a Voxel Feature Encoding (VFE) module inspired by PointNet to encode 3D point information within each pillar cell [3,22]. After features are extracted from individual pillars, they are then dispersed back into a 2D pseudo-image, arranged in a BEV perspective [1,3]. The subsequent detection process leverages standard 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on this pseudo-image to predict 3D bounding boxes [30,33,35].

A primary advantage of pillar-based methods, particularly when compared to voxel-based methods that rely on computationally intensive 3D convolutions, is their superior computational efficiency and reduced memory usage [22,33,35]. By eliminating the need for 3D CNN layers and processing data through efficient 2D convolutions, these methods significantly decrease computational load while maintaining competitive detection performance [1]. This makes them particularly well-suited for real-time applications in autonomous driving, where low latency is critical. Moreover, compared to point-based methods that directly process raw points, pillar-based approaches benefit from a structured grid representation, which can lead to more regular data access patterns and better utilization of hardware accelerators. PointPillars stands out as a representative and widely adopted model in this category, showcasing the practical effectiveness and efficiency of the pillar-based paradigm [22,30].
#### 3.1.4 BEV-Based Methods
Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based methods represent a prominent paradigm in 3D object detection for autonomous driving, garnering significant attention as evidenced by the rapid technological advancements in "BEV感知" (BEV perception) [17]. These methods primarily process point clouds by transforming sparse 3D point cloud data into a dense 2D representation from an overhead perspective. The fundamental approach involves projecting point clouds onto a bird's-eye view plane to create pseudo-images or 2D feature maps [3,4,30]. This transformation can be achieved by obtaining BEV feature maps from voxels and pillars by projecting the 3D features, or directly from raw point clouds by summarizing point statistics within pixel regions [33]. Following this projection, standard 2D object detection techniques are applied to the resulting BEV representation for feature extraction and subsequent object detection [4,30]. For instance, Voxel R-CNN incorporates a 2D BEV Region Proposal Network within its two-stage architecture [10].

The BEV representation offers significant advantages for capturing spatial relationships between objects, addressing several challenges inherent in 3D perception. Firstly, objects retain their physical size when projected onto the BEV plane, unlike other projection views that introduce perspective effects, which can distort object dimensions [21]. Secondly, the BEV perspective inherently minimizes occlusions and results in a spatially discrete distribution of objects, which simplifies detection tasks compared to cluttered 3D scenes [1,4,21]. This is particularly beneficial in road scenes where objects are typically situated on the ground, and vertical position changes are minimal, allowing the bird's-eye view to facilitate the acquisition of accurate 3D bounding boxes [21]. Moreover, BEV feature maps are considered the most efficient grid representation for point clouds, enabling 2D detection techniques to be seamlessly applied without substantial modifications, thereby achieving high efficiency and real-time inference speeds [3].

Despite these advantages, BEV-based methods are not without limitations. This representation may lead to a loss of specific 3D information, potentially affecting accuracy [33], and can result in the loss of longitudinal axis information, as observed in methods like PIXOR [4]. Furthermore, in multi-sensor fusion scenarios, accurately combining data from different modalities remains a challenge. For instance, while methods like 3D-CVF and SemanticBEVFusion transform and fuse both camera and LiDAR data within the BEV domain to leverage complementary information [8,13], issues such as feature misalignment caused by imprecise calibration between LiDAR and camera sensors can limit robustness. Approaches like GraphBEV aim to mitigate these limitations by explicitly addressing such misalignments to enhance the real-world applicability of BEV-based fusion methods [25]. The development of robust BEV feature transformation modules, as proposed in BFT3D, further underscores efforts to improve multi-sensor 3D object detection in the BEV domain [7]. While specific comparative performance benchmarks across diverse datasets are often detailed in dedicated survey papers or individual model evaluations, the inherent design of BEV-based methods contributes to their recognized efficiency and real-time capabilities in autonomous driving applications [3].
#### 3.1.5 Projection-Based Methods
Projection-based methods constitute a significant category within 3D object detection for autonomous driving, primarily by transforming sparse 3D point clouds into dense 2D image-like representations [30,35]. This transformation involves projecting points from the 3D space onto a 2D plane through a perspective transformation [22]. A notable advantage of this approach is its ability to leverage the highly optimized and efficient 2D convolutional operations for feature extraction, which have been extensively developed in the field of image processing [28]. Furthermore, these methods can generate relatively dense projection images and can be aligned with the pixel plane of vehicle cameras, facilitating effective multimodal fusion with camera imagery for enhanced detection capabilities [21].

The primary forms of projection-based point cloud representations include Front View (FV) and Bird's Eye View (BEV) [22].

Front View (FV) Projection: In FV projection, the 3D point cloud is projected onto a spherical or cylindrical surface, with the LiDAR sensor positioned at the origin [22]. Subsequently, this surface is unrolled into a 2D plane, resulting in a dense and structured distance image [22]. To preserve critical 3D information within this 2D format, the pixels in the FV image are encoded with a variety of features. These typically include binary occupancy coding, 3D coordinates, distance from the sensor, azimuth angle, and the reflection intensity of the corresponding points [22]. The choice and number of these initial features directly influence the information density of the FV distance image [22].

Bird's Eye View (BEV) Projection: BEV projection transforms the 3D point cloud into a top-down 2D grid map with a predefined grid resolution, denoted as $\lambda$ meters [22]. Points within the 3D space are assigned to their corresponding grid cells in the BEV map, where a single grid cell may encompass multiple points [22]. Similar to FV, the richness of the 3D information preserved in the BEV image is determined by the encoding features assigned to each grid cell or pixel. Common encoding schemes include binary occupancy coding for fixed-size partitions along the Z-axis (height information) and statistical values derived from the points within each grid, such as maximum height, average intensity, or point count [22].

While projection-based methods offer computational efficiency by leveraging 2D convolutions, their primary challenge lies in effectively preserving the rich 3D spatial information during the dimensionality reduction from 3D to 2D. The design of sophisticated feature encoding strategies, as detailed for FV and BEV, is crucial to mitigate information loss and maintain the fidelity of the 3D scene representation. These encoding techniques attempt to embed essential depth, height, and other spatial attributes into the 2D image channels, thereby enabling subsequent 2D networks to implicitly reason about the 3D environment. The impact of these projection techniques on preserving 3D information is directly tied to the selection and encoding of these features, which dictate the extent to which the original spatial relationships and characteristics of objects are retained for detection.
#### 3.1.6 Graph-Based Methods
Graph-based methods have emerged as a distinct approach for processing point cloud data in 3D object detection, particularly in autonomous driving applications. These methods leverage the inherent unstructured nature of point clouds by representing them as graphs and then employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction and learning [30,35].

In this paradigm, a point cloud is explicitly converted into a graph structure [22]. Each individual point within the point cloud is conceptualized as a node in the graph, establishing the fundamental entities of the representation [22]. Connections (i.e., edges) are then established between these nodes based on their spatial proximity; specifically, an edge is formed between a point and all other points residing within a predefined fixed radius, denoted as $d$ [22]. This radius-based connectivity facilitates the capture of local structural information within the point cloud.

For feature extraction, the initial features for each node are derived by considering its local neighborhood. This process typically involves selecting a set of points within a radius $d$ around the target node [22]. The canonical coordinates and reflection intensity values of these neighboring points are then processed through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) [22]. Subsequently, a pooling operation—such as a max operation—is applied to aggregate the processed features from these neighboring points, yielding a concise initial feature vector for the central node [22]. These initial node features, along with the constructed graph structure, are then fed into GNNs, which are specifically designed to propagate information across the graph and learn high-level representations by aggregating features from connected nodes.

Despite their ability to inherently model the relationships between points, graph-based methods face significant challenges, notably in graph construction and computational complexity [35]. Constructing a graph for a dense, high-resolution original point cloud can be computationally very inefficient [22]. To mitigate this, a common practice involves utilizing a sampled point cloud—often obtained through voxelization—instead of the raw point cloud. This preprocessing step significantly reduces the number of nodes, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with graph construction and subsequent GNN processing. However, even with such optimizations, the computational cost can remain substantial, especially for real-time applications in autonomous driving that require rapid inference on large-scale point clouds [35].
### 3.2 Camera-Based Methods
Camera-based 3D object detection tackles the crucial challenge of perceiving three-dimensional information about objects in autonomous driving environments using visual sensors. This approach, however, inherently struggles with the lack of direct depth information in 2D images. The absence of depth cues creates an ill-posed problem compounded by issues such as scale variation and occlusion, which together limit detection accuracy and robustness [2,4]. Consequently, a central focus of camera-based methods is the effective estimation of depth and the inference of 3D properties from 2D visual cues [26].

Methodologies in camera-based 3D object detection are broadly categorized according to their input configuration and processing pipeline. Monocular 3D object detection, which relies on a single camera, is a cost-effective solution but faces significant challenges due to the inherent ambiguity associated with depth estimation from a single perspective [2]. To address this, methods often incorporate explicit depth estimation—converting images into pseudo-LiDAR point clouds—or employ implicit geometric reasoning that leverages 2D-3D correspondences alongside prior knowledge [4,30]. Yet, despite these strategies, monocular methods tend to exhibit lower accuracy as the difficulty of precise depth inference persists [2].

In contrast, stereo 3D object detection uses two or more cameras to infer depth maps through disparity estimation, thereby providing geometric constraints that significantly enhance the retrieval of 3D information [2,3]. This additional depth accuracy allows for the reconstruction of more precise 3D point clouds, which can then be processed for object detection. However, stereo methods introduce increased complexity and higher computational costs due to the demands of stereo matching algorithms and data processing [2].

From an architectural standpoint, camera-based methods are generally classified into two paradigms: two-stage and one-stage. Two-stage methods typically begin by generating 2D object proposals from the image, followed by a second stage that lifts these detections into 3D space to estimate attributes such as depth, orientation, and dimensions [26,27]. This sequential approach allows for refinement at each step. Conversely, one-stage methods strive for efficiency and simplicity by directly regressing target properties without relying on an intermediate proposal generation phase. These methods can be further divided into anchor-based and anchor-free approaches, streamlining the pipeline for real-time performance; a notable example in monocular settings is FCOS3D [23,27].

Despite ongoing innovations, camera-based approaches generally lag in accuracy and robustness compared to LiDAR-based systems, particularly in scenarios with significant occlusion or challenging lighting conditions [2]. The quality of depth estimation remains the primary bottleneck, directly influencing overall performance. Future research is expected to bridge this gap by developing more sophisticated depth inference techniques, integrating temporal information, and exploring advanced network architectures to enhance the capabilities of camera-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving.
#### 3.2.1 Monocular 3D Object Detection
Monocular 3D object detection, which aims to perceive the 3D position and dimensions of objects from a single 2D image, presents a significant challenge due to its inherent ill-posed nature [3]. The primary difficulty stems from the inability of monocular images to provide sufficient 3D information, particularly accurate depth measurements, thereby severely limiting detection accuracy [2,3].

Monocular 3D object detection methods can be broadly classified based on how they address this crucial depth perception problem: through explicit depth estimation or by leveraging geometric reasoning and prior knowledge [3,26,30].

Methods relying on **explicit depth estimation** typically infer a depth map from the input image, which is then often converted into a pseudo-LiDAR point cloud. This pseudo-LiDAR representation can subsequently be processed by existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors. For instance, MF3D and Mono3D-PLiDAR exemplify this approach by employing a monocular depth estimation module to calculate disparity, which is then transformed into a pseudo-LiDAR point cloud for 3D box prediction [4]. Improved image quality is directly beneficial for these methods, as they heavily depend on precise visual cues for accurate depth inference [32].

Conversely, a substantial category of methods addresses depth perception implicitly through **geometric reasoning and the application of various priors**. These techniques typically leverage the relationship between 2D image projections and 3D object properties to infer 3D bounding box attributes and mitigate perspective distortion [26,30].
*   **Result-lifting based methods** infer 3D properties from 2D detections. For example, Mono3D scores 3D proposals by incorporating location priors, object shape, size, and semantics, often hypothesizing that objects are close to the ground plane via an energy minimization framework [1,4]. It samples 3D candidate objects directly from 3D space without explicit depth calculation, instead using semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and location priors for candidate box scoring [4].
*   **Geometry-based methods** directly infer 3D poses from 2D detection boxes based on geometric properties. Deep3DBox, for instance, utilizes the geometric property that the perspective projection of 3D corners should tightly align with at least one side of the 2D bounding box [1,4]. GS3D is another example, relying on the observation that the projected top center of a 3D bounding box should be in close proximity to the top midpoint of its corresponding 2D bounding box [1]. GS3D further refines 3D detection by predicting an additional direction and extracting features from 2D and 3D box surfaces for optimization [4]. Deep MANTA recovers 3D structures by matching 2D detection boxes with 3D templates from a large CAD dataset [4]. Stereo R-CNN, while using a weight-sharing network for feature extraction from stereo images, ultimately predicts 3D boxes through geometric constraints between 2D boxes and 3D corner point projections, demonstrating a strong reliance on geometric principles for 3D inference [4].

Modern end-to-end approaches integrate 3D regression directly into the network. FCOS3D, an anchor-free single-stage method, transforms 3D targets to the image domain and decouples them into 2D and 3D attributes [23]. It directly regresses the offset from the center to a specific foreground point ($\Delta x$, $\Delta y$) and its corresponding depth ($d$), along with the allocentric orientation of the object, which is typically divided into an angle $\theta$ (with period $\pi$) and a 2-bin direction classification [23]. Other notable monocular methods include AutoShape and RAR-Net [26].

In terms of architectural classifications, monocular methods can be further categorized into one-stage anchor-based (e.g., M3D-RPN), one-stage anchor-free (e.g., CenterNet), and two-stage methods (e.g., ROI-10D) [27].

Despite advancements, monocular 3D object detection methods face inherent limitations due to the ambiguity of depth information from a single camera. This struggle to estimate depth accurately severely limits their overall detection accuracy [2]. For instance, on the challenging KITTI dataset, even leading monocular methods like DD3D have achieved a comparatively modest performance, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of only 16.87% [2]. While offering a cost-effective solution due to relying on a single camera, their performance typically lags behind multi-modal or stereo-based approaches, underscoring the ongoing challenge of robust depth inference from monocular cues.
#### 3.2.2 Stereo 3D Object Detection
Stereo 3D object detection leverages a pair of images captured by two or more cameras to infer comprehensive three-dimensional information about objects in a scene [3]. Unlike monocular methods, stereo cameras provide inherent geometric constraints, enabling the estimation of more precise depth maps [2,3]. The fundamental process in stereo methods involves stereo matching algorithms to estimate disparity maps, which subsequently facilitate the reconstruction of 3D point clouds [26,30]. This reconstructed 3D information is then utilized to predict 3D bounding boxes for object localization and classification.

The methodologies for extracting 3D information from disparity maps and predicting 3D bounding boxes can be broadly categorized into three main approaches: 2D detection-based, virtual LiDAR-based, and voxel-based methods [27]. In 2D detection-based paradigms, exemplified by Stereo R-CNN, the system exploits geometric alignment, keypoints, yaw angle, and object shape using left and right image proposal pairs to infer 3D properties [1]. Other notable methods in this category include S3D-RCNN and YOLOStereo3D [26]. Virtual LiDAR-based methods, such as P-LiDAR++, construct a pseudo-LiDAR point cloud from the estimated depth information, which is then processed by 3D detection networks typically designed for real LiDAR data [27]. Voxel-based methods, including DSGN, discretize the 3D space into voxels and process this volumetric representation to detect objects [26,27]. The choice and refinement of stereo matching algorithms are critical, as their accuracy directly impacts the quality of the disparity maps and, consequently, the precision of the reconstructed 3D point clouds and final detection performance. State-of-the-art stereo methods, such as LIGA-Stereo, have demonstrated significant performance, achieving 64.66% mAP on the challenging KITTI dataset, underscoring their potential for robust 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios [2].
#### 3.2.3 Two-Stage Methods
Two-stage methods for 3D object detection typically follow a pipeline that first identifies two-dimensional (2D) object proposals and subsequently lifts these proposals into three-dimensional (3D) space to estimate their properties [26,27,30]. This approach is particularly common in monocular 3D object detection, where 2D bounding boxes serve as an initial estimate for object locations on the image plane, from which 3D attributes such as depth, orientation, and 3D dimensions are then inferred [27].

The initial stage involves generating accurate 2D object proposals, often leveraging established 2D object detection techniques. Following this, the second stage focuses on estimating the complete 3D properties for each generated 2D proposal. For instance, early methods in monocular 3D object detection, such as Mono3D and 3DOP, exemplify this two-stage paradigm, where 2D detection results are foundational for subsequent 3D inference [26].

In multi-modal scenarios, the proposal refinement stage within two-stage methods can involve sophisticated feature fusion techniques. For example, some approaches perform camera-LiDAR feature fusion during the proposal refinement phase, often utilizing RoI-based feature pooling to integrate information from different sensor modalities [13]. Furthermore, advanced fusion strategies may incorporate a voxel point segmentation module to predict foreground voxel scores, weighting these scores into a global voxel-image fusion process. This cross-modal fusion aims to better guide the integration of LiDAR point cloud data and camera image data, enhancing the overall detection performance [6].

Regarding the analysis of advantages and disadvantages of using 2D detectors as a base for 3D object detection, the provided digests, specifically [26], do not explicitly detail these aspects.
#### 3.2.4 One-Stage Methods
One-stage methods in 3D object detection are designed for enhanced efficiency and simplicity by directly regressing the target properties without an intermediate proposal generation stage, a characteristic that often contributes to real-time performance [18]. This approach streamlines the detection pipeline, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications where low latency is critical. Prominent examples of one-stage detectors include 6DoF-3D [28] and YOLO3D [18].

Within the one-stage paradigm, methods are primarily categorized into anchor-based and anchor-free approaches [26,27,30]. Anchor-based methods rely on a predefined set of anchor boxes with various scales, aspect ratios, and orientations, which serve as initial hypotheses for object locations. While effective, the design and optimization of these anchors can introduce complexity, as they must be carefully tuned to the dataset's object distribution to achieve optimal performance.

Conversely, anchor-free methods aim to simplify the detection pipeline by eliminating the need for predefined anchors, thereby reducing the complexity associated with anchor tuning and matching. Instead, these methods directly predict the properties of objects at each spatial location. This is typically achieved through multiple prediction branches that simultaneously output crucial attributes such as categories, keypoints, spatial offsets, depth information, object size, and orientation [27]. FCOS3D is a notable example of a one-stage, anchor-free method, specifically applied in monocular 3D object detection [23]. Other examples in monocular 3D detection include Movi-3D and AutoShape [26].

The trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free methods manifest in both performance and complexity. Anchor-based methods can provide strong baselines due to their exhaustive coverage of potential object locations, but they often grapple with sensitivity to anchor design and the computational burden of processing numerous anchors. Anchor-free methods, by contrast, offer a simpler and more flexible framework, potentially leading to fewer hyperparameters and a more direct learning process. Their direct regression approach can, however, require sophisticated network architectures to accurately capture all necessary 3D properties without the guidance of initial anchors. Both paradigms continue to be actively researched, with advancements in network design and training strategies continuously pushing the boundaries of efficiency and accuracy in 3D object detection.
### 3.3 Multi-Modal Fusion Methods

**Comparison of Multi-Modal Fusion Strategies**

| Strategy              | Integration Stage        | Advantages                                                  | Disadvantages                                                            | Suitability                                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Early Fusion**      | Raw/Minimally processed data (input stage). | Maximize direct interaction, fine-grained information capture.            | High computational complexity, highly sensitive to noise/misalignment.   | Applications with precise data alignment, high-quality synchronized raw data.    |
| **Intermediate Fusion** | Features within network backbone (feature extraction, proposal generation). | Balances data interaction and computational efficiency, robust to minor noise. | Considerable computational complexity, careful architectural design needed. | Widely adopted for complex real-world scenarios, strong performance-robustness trade-off. |
| **Late Fusion**       | Final predictions/outputs (after independent processing). | Computationally less demanding per branch, high modularity, robust to individual sensor failures. | Loses early, fine-grained complementary information, potential conflict resolution issues. | Resource-constrained environments, critical robustness to sensor failure, independent optimization desired. |

The accurate and robust perception of the environment is fundamental for autonomous driving systems. While individual sensors, such as LiDAR and cameras, provide distinct advantages, they also possess inherent limitations. LiDAR sensors excel at providing precise 3D geometric and depth information, crucial for accurate localization and sizing of objects, but typically lack rich textural and semantic context. Conversely, cameras capture dense visual information, including color and texture, which is vital for object classification and understanding contextual cues, yet they inherently struggle with direct depth estimation and are susceptible to varying lighting conditions [3,16]. The integration of these complementary modalities, often referred to as multi-modal fusion, is therefore critical. By fusing data from LiDAR and cameras, and sometimes incorporating additional sensors like radar or high-definition (HD) maps, autonomous driving systems can achieve a more comprehensive, robust, and accurate perception of the surrounding environment, thereby significantly improving 3D object detection performance [9,11,21,24,27,30].

The effectiveness of multi-modal fusion critically depends on the chosen fusion strategy, which dictates when and how data from different modalities are integrated within the detection pipeline [24]. Broadly, fusion strategies are categorized into early, intermediate (or deep), and late fusion, each offering distinct trade-offs in terms of performance, computational complexity, and robustness to noise and misalignment [2,21,27]. Early fusion, which combines raw or minimally processed data at the input stage, allows for the most direct interaction and fine-grained information capture, though it is highly sensitive to sensor synchronization and calibration errors. Intermediate or deep fusion integrates features at various stages within the network backbone, balancing direct data interaction with computational efficiency, and is widely adopted due to its ability to learn robust representations and adaptively leverage complementary information, often via attention mechanisms [6,7,8,9,13,25,34]. Late fusion, conversely, processes modalities independently and combines their predictions at the final stage, offering modularity and robustness to individual sensor failures at the cost of losing early, fine-grained interactions. Beyond these primary classifications, hybrid approaches like cascaded fusion and varying levels of granularity—from point-level and voxel-level to feature-level and RoI-level fusion—further define the diverse landscape of multi-modal integration techniques [2,4].

Despite the clear benefits, multi-sensor fusion introduces significant challenges, primarily related to calibration errors, data association, and managing the inherent differences in data formats and densities between modalities [1,4]. Misalignment between sensor data, whether due to imperfect initial calibration or dynamic environmental factors, can severely degrade detection performance. Consequently, a crucial aspect of multi-modal research involves developing sophisticated methods to address the alignment of features from different modalities and robustly handle miscalibration between sensors. Innovative approaches, such as the use of local and global alignment modules for LiDAR and camera Bird's Eye View (BEV) features [25], cross-view spatial feature fusion that transforms camera features to correspond with LiDAR data [13], and multi-level fusion paradigms that integrate information across various granularities [6], have been proposed. Furthermore, attention-guided fusion mechanisms and techniques that simulate sensor perturbations enhance resilience against minor misalignments, contributing to the overall robustness of the system [7]. Ultimately, the generally superior robustness of multi-modal approaches stems from their ability to provide complementary information and compensate for individual sensor weaknesses, making them indispensable for reliable 3D object detection in dynamic autonomous driving environments [11].
#### 3.3.1 Fusion Strategies
The selection of an appropriate fusion strategy is a critical design choice in multi-modal 3D object detection for autonomous driving, significantly influencing performance, computational efficiency, and robustness [24]. Fusion strategies are broadly classified based on the stage at which data from different modalities are integrated into the network, typically categorized as early fusion, intermediate (or deep) fusion, and late fusion [2,21,30]. Other perspectives include serial versus parallel fusion, and various levels of fusion such as data, feature, and result fusion [4,21].

**Early Fusion (Front Fusion / Data Fusion)**  
Early fusion involves combining raw or minimally pre-processed data from different sensors at the input stage or very early feature extraction layers [2,21,27]. For instance, this can involve integrating image knowledge directly into the point cloud before it enters the LiDAR detection pipeline [3].
*   **Advantages**: Early fusion allows for the most direct interaction between multi-modal features, enabling the model to learn the most intricate and fine-grained complementary information from the raw data [2]. This can lead to richer combined features and potentially higher accuracy if the data is perfectly aligned and synchronized.
*   **Disadvantages**: This strategy typically incurs high computational complexity due to the large volume of raw data being processed simultaneously. It is also highly sensitive to sensor noise and misalignment; poor data quality from one sensor can propagate errors throughout the entire system and significantly degrade overall performance. Handling asynchronous data streams effectively is another challenge.
*   **Suitability**: Early fusion is suitable for applications where extremely precise data alignment and high-quality, synchronized raw sensor data are guaranteed, and computational resources are ample. It is preferred when maximizing the capture of subtle complementary cues is paramount.

**Intermediate Fusion (Deep Fusion / Feature Fusion)**  
Intermediate or deep fusion strategies integrate features from different modalities at various stages within the network's backbone, feature extraction, proposal generation, or RoI refinement phases [3,21,27]. This approach combines aspects of both early and late fusion, balancing direct interaction with feature abstraction [21]. Many advanced methods employ deep fusion, integrating features at multiple levels within the network, often using attention mechanisms to adaptively extract informative features [7,9,13,34]. Examples include feature-level fusion in the middle layer of feature extraction and RoI-level fusion on local RoI grids [6,13]. Approaches like Multi-View 3D object detection network (MV3D), Aggregate View Object Detection Network (AVOD), and ContFuse are examples of multi-view-based methods that deeply fuse regional features from various perspectives like Bird's Eye View (BEV), LiDAR Front View (FV), and images to overcome individual sensor limitations [16]. Innovations like GraphBEV [25] and SemanticBEVFusion [8] also exemplify deep fusion in a unified BEV representation, addressing feature misalignment through advanced alignment modules.
*   **Advantages**: This strategy offers a balance between fine-grained data interaction and computational efficiency, as it operates on more abstract, reduced-dimension features. It is generally more robust to raw sensor noise and minor misalignments compared to early fusion, as the features have undergone some level of processing and abstraction. Intermediate fusion excels at capturing complementary information by learning robust representations from partially processed data.
*   **Disadvantages**: The computational complexity remains considerable, and the design of effective fusion mechanisms (e.g., handling feature misalignment) requires careful architectural considerations.
*   **Suitability**: Intermediate fusion is widely adopted for autonomous driving applications as it offers a strong trade-off between performance and robustness, making it suitable for complex real-world scenarios where leveraging both raw data insights and high-level feature abstractions is crucial.

**Late Fusion (Rear Fusion / Result Fusion)**  
Late fusion employs separate processing branches for each modality, combining their outputs or predictions at the final prediction stage [2,21].
*   **Advantages**: This strategy is computationally less demanding for individual branches, simpler to implement, and offers high modularity. It exhibits significant robustness to individual sensor failures; if one sensor or processing branch malfunctions, the others can still provide valid predictions. It is also more amenable to handling asynchronous data streams.
*   **Disadvantages**: The primary drawback is the loss of early interaction between modalities, which means that fine-grained complementary information present in the raw data or early features cannot be leveraged. This can lead to less accurate or less consistent results compared to earlier fusion strategies, as potential conflicts or ambiguities between modality-specific predictions must be resolved at a higher, less informative level.
*   **Suitability**: Late fusion is well-suited for resource-constrained environments, applications where robustness to individual sensor failure is critical, or when integrating heterogeneous sensor types with disparate processing pipelines. It is also beneficial when modularity and independent optimization of modality-specific networks are prioritized.

**Other Fusion Perspectives**  
Beyond the stage-based classification, fusion methods can also be categorized by their operational principles. **Serial fusion** integrates learned features sequentially, where the current stage heavily depends on the previous stage. This tight coupling can hinder efficient end-to-end training and means that poor results in earlier stages can significantly worsen subsequent performance [20]. In contrast, **parallel fusion** integrates features into a multi-modal representation via a single learning process, offering potentially more robust joint learning, though viewpoint deviations between sensors can still affect detection results [20]. **Cascaded fusion** represents a hybrid approach, integrating predictions from one branch with the inputs of another to establish inter-modal relationships [2]. Furthermore, the employment of attention-based mechanisms in fusion, as seen in various deep fusion models [7,13,34], allows the network to adaptively weigh the importance of features from different modalities, thereby enhancing the ability to capture complementary information and improve robustness. These advanced deep fusion techniques are often integral to methods that leverage multi-view feature integration, aiming to compensate for the inherent limitations of single modalities, such as the lack of texture in point clouds or depth information in monocular images [16].
#### 3.3.2 Fusion Modalities and Granularity
Multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving leverages the complementary strengths of various sensor modalities to enhance detection performance, especially regarding robustness and accuracy [30]. Typical sensor combinations include LiDAR and camera, radar and camera, and LiDAR and radar, each offering unique advantages [27,30]. LiDAR sensors provide accurate 3D geometric and depth information, crucial for precise localization and sizing of objects. Cameras, conversely, capture rich textural, color, and semantic features, which are vital for object classification and understanding contextual cues. Radar, while lower in resolution, offers robust distance and velocity measurements, particularly excelling in adverse weather conditions where other sensors may be degraded [27]. Advanced approaches also integrate high-definition (HD) maps, converting them into Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations for fusion with rasterized BEV point clouds or feature maps, providing crucial static environmental context [27]. For instance, some models fuse visual data from cameras (processed by networks like ResNet-50) with sequential data from LiDAR and radar inputs (processed by LSTMs), demonstrating the potential for combining diverse data streams [34].

A critical aspect of multi-modal fusion lies in defining both the "fusion inputs" (what data to fuse) and "fusion granularity" (how to fuse) [24]. Fusion inputs can range from raw sensor data or pre-processed data to extracted feature vectors, feature maps, or even the calculated results from sub-models [21]. The choice of fusion granularity significantly impacts the system's accuracy, efficiency, and complexity. This granularity can generally be categorized into early, mid-level, and late fusion.

Early fusion, often referred to as point-level or voxel-level fusion, integrates data at the lowest level of abstraction. In this approach, raw sensor data is combined before significant processing. A common method involves projecting LiDAR point clouds onto the pixel plane of RGB images, adding them as an extended fourth channel to the images [21]. Point-level fusion aggregates each 3D point with image features or masks to capture dense contextual information [2]. Voxel-level fusion projects voxelized point cloud data onto the image plane, subsequently attaching image features to each voxel [2]. While early fusion can preserve the maximum amount of raw information, potentially leading to higher accuracy, it is highly sensitive to sensor miscalibration and synchronization issues, increasing complexity.

Mid-level fusion, predominantly feature-level fusion, combines data after initial feature extraction but before final detection. For image branches, typical fusion inputs include feature maps, image masks, and pseudo LiDAR point clouds. For point cloud branches, voxelized point clouds, raw point clouds, and BEV or Range View (RV) projections are commonly used [2]. This approach balances detail preservation with robustness to minor misalignments. Examples include feature-level fusion using gated feature fusion networks [13] and multi-modal RoI pooling that aggregates 3D voxel and 2D image features via deformable cross-attention onto each RoI grid point [6].

Late fusion, also known as object-level or RoI-level fusion, integrates information at the highest level of abstraction, combining the detection results or proposals from individual sensor streams. RoI-level fusion is frequently employed to refine initial proposals [2]. Another method involves projecting 2D image detections into 3D point cloud space to create frustums, subsequently refined by feature-level processing within a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [9]. Late fusion generally offers greater robustness to miscalibration and less computational overhead during early processing stages, but it may fail to leverage fine-grained correlations between modalities that could be beneficial for accuracy.

A significant challenge in multi-modal fusion is sensor calibration and data alignment. Misalignment between sensor data can severely degrade performance, transforming complementary information into noise. Methods to handle miscalibration are crucial. For instance, in LiDAR-camera fusion for BEV 3D object detection, approaches involve both local alignment (LocalAlign) using neighbor-aware depth features and global alignment (GlobalAlign) using learnable offsets to correct misalignments between LiDAR and camera BEV features [25]. Radar data fusion with LiDAR or camera also presents unique challenges, with methods including voxel-based, attention-based, distance-azimuth-Doppler tensor methods, graph neural networks, dynamic occupancy grids, and 4D radar data processing [27].

Future research directions in fusion modalities and granularity should focus on developing more robust and adaptive calibration techniques that can dynamically adjust to sensor drift or environmental changes. Exploring novel learnable fusion architectures that can intelligently weigh information from different sensors based on their reliability and quality under varying conditions is also promising. Furthermore, research could delve into sophisticated feature representation learning across modalities, allowing for seamless integration of highly disparate data types while preserving their inherent strengths. Investigating methods for real-time performance optimization across different fusion granularities, potentially leveraging hardware acceleration, will also be vital for practical autonomous driving applications.
## 4. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics
The comprehensive evaluation of 3D object detection algorithms in autonomous driving necessitates the use of diverse and representative datasets, alongside robust and precisely defined evaluation metrics. The selection of appropriate datasets and metrics profoundly influences the assessment of model performance, generalization ability, and suitability for real‐world autonomous driving scenarios.

Several publicly available datasets serve as critical benchmarks for 3D object detection algorithms, each possessing distinct characteristics in terms of scale, diversity, and scene complexity. Prominent examples include KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset [1,6,20,26]. The **KITTI dataset** provides 50 scenes across 8 object categories and comprises approximately 3,712 training, 3,769 validation, and 7,518 testing samples [1,5]. It includes stereo color images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates, supporting tasks such as stereo matching, visual odometry, and 3D object detection [2]. While foundational, KITTI’s relatively smaller scale and limited diversity, particularly regarding sensor modalities and environmental conditions, can pose challenges for training models with strong generalization capabilities.

In contrast, the **nuScenes dataset** offers significantly larger scale and greater diversity, featuring 1,000 sequences across 23 object categories, with 28k training, 6k validation, and 6k testing samples [1,5]. It is characterized by its multi‐modal sensor suite, including 6 cameras, a 32‐beam LiDAR, and radar sensors for measuring object velocities, providing comprehensive 3D annotations [2,23,25]. The dataset’s extensive coverage of varied driving scenarios and inclusion of radar data, which is beneficial for velocity estimation, contributes to its robustness for evaluating modern 3D object detection methods, especially for challenging distant objects [8].

The **Waymo Open Dataset** further expands on data scale and sensor richness, encompassing 1,150 sequences over 4 object classes. It provides 2D and 3D labeled data from 5 LiDAR sensors and 5 pinhole cameras, capturing a wide array of diverse driving environments [1,2]. Beyond these primary benchmarks, other datasets such as ApolloScape, BDD100K, A2D2, H3D, Lyft, SemanticKITTI, Argoverse, Cityscapes 3D, AIODrive, and the Robot Car dataset from Oxford University contribute to the research landscape, often specializing in particular aspects like specific sensor configurations or challenging conditions such as low illumination [2,19,22,34]. While all these datasets generally contain LiDAR sensor data and labeled 3D bounding boxes, they differ significantly in their number of labeled targets and target categories [22].

The inherent characteristics and potential biases within these datasets critically impact the performance and generalization ability of 3D object detection models. Models trained exclusively on datasets with limited scene diversity or specific environmental conditions may exhibit poor generalization when deployed in novel or challenging scenarios. To address the robustness of algorithms against such biases and real‐world perturbations, evaluations are increasingly conducted on corrupted datasets like KITTI-C and nuScenes-C, ensuring fair comparisons and revealing vulnerabilities that might not be apparent on clean data [11]. For instance, studies have shown that detection accuracy can vary significantly under different occlusion levels (easy, medium, difficult) [9] or in low illumination environments, highlighting the need for diverse training data and robust evaluation strategies.

Evaluation metrics for 3D object detection extend traditional 2D metrics to the 3D domain while also incorporating measures relevant to autonomous driving applications. The most common metric is **Average Precision (AP)** and its variant, **mean Average Precision (mAP)**, which quantifies the area under the precision-recall curve [1,23,26]. The fundamental concept of **Intersection-over-Union (IoU)** is widely used to define successful detections, calculated as:

$$
IoU = \frac{Area(B_p \cap B_{gt})}{Area(B_p \cup B_{gt})}
$$

where $B_p$ is the predicted bounding box and $B_{gt}$ is the ground truth bounding box [26].

However, specific benchmarks often employ customized metrics to better reflect their data characteristics and evaluation goals:

• **KITTI** adopts the standard **Interpolated Metric** as its official evaluation criterion. This metric computes the mean precision calculated at a subset of evenly spaced recall levels $R$. Its formulation is given by:

$$
\text{Interpolated Metric} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{r \in R} p_{interp}(r)
$$

where 

$$
R = \left\{ \frac{1}{N}, \frac{2}{N}, \dots, 1 \right\}
$$

and

$$
p_{interp}(r) = \max_{\tilde{r}:\tilde{r} \geq r} p(\tilde{r}).
$$

[1].

• **nuScenes** primarily uses **mAP** and the comprehensive **nuScenes Detection Score (NDS)**. Notably, nuScenes defines a match based on a 2D center distance on the ground plane rather than 3D IoU for thresholding. The mAP is computed across various matching thresholds $\mathcal{D} = \{0.5, 1, 2, 4\}$ meters and all categories $\mathcal{C}$:

$$
mAP = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}||\mathcal{D}|} \sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}} \sum_{d\in \mathcal{D}} AP_{c,d}
$$

[23]. NDS is designed to provide a holistic assessment by combining mAP with several True Positive (TP) error metrics, including Average Translation Error (ATE), Average Scale Error (ASE), Average Orientation Error (AOE), Average Velocity Error (AVE), and Average Attribute Error (AAE). The formula for NDS is given as:

$$
NDS = mAP - \sum_{e \in E} \lambda_e mAE_e
$$

where $E$ represents the set of mean average errors for translation, size, orientation, attribute, and velocity, and $\lambda_e$ are their respective weights [1]. This comprehensive metric makes NDS particularly suitable for evaluating the overall quality of detections, including localization, size, orientation, and velocity accuracy, which are critical for downstream planning tasks in autonomous driving [3].

• The **Waymo Open Dataset** also utilizes the Interpolated Metric and introduces **Average Precision weighted by Heading (APH)** as a primary metric. APH incorporates the accuracy of estimated object heading by weighting true positives with $\cos(\Delta \theta)$, where $\Delta \theta$ is the angular difference between predicted and ground truth azimuths [1].

• Other specialized metrics encountered include **Average Orientation Similarity (AOS)**, defined as

$$
AOS = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{i \in D(r)} \cos\bigl(\delta(i)\bigr),
$$

where $\delta(i)$ is the angle difference [26], and metrics like EPE3D (m) for 3D error, Acc5 (%) and Acc10 (%) for top-k accuracy, and $\theta$ (rad) for rotation angle error [34].

The suitability of different metrics depends on the specific aspects of performance being assessed. AP and mAP are fundamental for overall detection accuracy, indicating how well a model can identify and localize objects. However, for applications like autonomous driving, where precise control and prediction are paramount, metrics that account for specific error types (e.g., ATE, AOE within NDS) or critical attributes like heading (APH) become indispensable. The use of corrupted datasets like KITTI-C and nuScenes-C, alongside these detailed metrics, is crucial for evaluating the robustness of algorithms under non-ideal, real-world conditions, providing a more reliable indicator of their generalization ability and practical deployment readiness [11]. While some metrics attempt to extend 2D AP to 3D, others are designed from a more practical perspective, linking the quality of 3D object detection directly to downstream tasks such as motion planning [3]. The choice of dataset and evaluation metric thus directly impacts the interpretation of reported performance and the validity of comparisons between different 3D object detection methods.
## 5. Robustness in 3D Object Detection
Robustness is a critical facet of 3D object detection algorithms, fundamentally impacting the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. This section comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted challenges to robustness and the advanced methodologies employed to mitigate them. The discussion commences by examining the profound influence of diverse environmental factors, such as varying lighting conditions and adverse weather, on detection accuracy and reliability [11,32]. It then delves into the pervasive issues of noise and sensor malfunctions, including spatial misalignment and miscalibration, which directly compromise the integrity of sensory data and the subsequent performance of detection algorithms [7,25].

Beyond environmental and sensor-related disturbances, the section addresses the critical vulnerability of 3D object detection systems to adversarial attacks. These malicious perturbations can lead to erroneous detections, posing significant safety risks, and necessitate a thorough exploration of various defense mechanisms [11]. To counter these challenges, a spectrum of mitigation techniques is discussed, encompassing data-centric approaches like sophisticated data augmentation strategies and domain adaptation methods that bridge performance gaps across diverse conditions [23,25,32]. Furthermore, advancements in model-centric strategies, such as adaptive sensor fusion mechanisms and fault-tolerant algorithms, are highlighted for their capacity to enhance resilience against data anomalies and sensor imperfections [7,21]. The overarching goal is to summarize and analyze these diverse techniques for improving robustness, assessing their performance gains and inherent limitations. Finally, the section outlines the characteristics of datasets and the evaluation metrics specifically tailored for assessing the robustness of 3D object detection systems in real-world autonomous driving scenarios [11].
### 5.1 Environmental Factors
Environmental factors significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of 3D object detection systems in autonomous driving. Among these, varying lighting and weather conditions present substantial challenges to the robustness of detection algorithms.

Low illumination is identified as a critical environmental factor that profoundly impacts object detection performance [32]. Poor lighting conditions can lead to a considerable degradation in detection accuracy and a reduction in the total number of detected objects [32]. To mitigate these adverse effects, methods focusing on image enhancement are crucial [11,32].

Beyond lighting, diverse weather conditions, including clear and rainy scenarios, and the fundamental distinction between daytime and nighttime operation, introduce considerable variability into detector performance [25]. Comparative analyses of different algorithms under these varying conditions highlight their differing levels of robustness. For instance, GraphBEV has demonstrated superior performance compared to BEVFusion across a range of environmental settings, particularly exhibiting enhanced efficacy in challenging nighttime environments [25]. This outcome underscores the imperative for developing algorithms capable of maintaining consistent and high-fidelity detection capabilities across a broad spectrum of real-world operational scenarios.

To enhance the overall resilience of 3D object detection systems against such environmental variabilities, the strategic implementation of techniques like image enhancement and domain adaptation is essential [11,32]. These approaches are designed to counteract the performance degradation induced by suboptimal environmental conditions, thereby contributing to the improved robustness and reliability of 3D object detection in autonomous driving applications.
### 5.2 Noise and Sensor Malfunctions
The accuracy and reliability of 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems are significantly challenged by noise and sensor malfunctions [11]. These issues can manifest as spatial misalignment or sensor miscalibration, directly impacting the integrity of sensory data and, consequently, the performance of downstream detection algorithms.

Spatial misalignment, often arising from sensor perturbations, introduces inaccuracies in the relative positioning of detected objects and their true locations. Mitigating such effects necessitates robust feature transformation mechanisms to ensure that the spatial relationships between features remain consistent despite these perturbations [7].

Another critical challenge is sensor miscalibration, which leads to erroneous global offsets between different sensor modalities, particularly between LiDAR and camera data. To address this, some approaches integrate fault-tolerant sensor fusion strategies. For instance, the GlobalAlign module has been proposed to specifically learn and correct these global offsets during the fusion process [25]. By dynamically adjusting for miscalibration, this module enhances the overall robustness of the 3D object detection system, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning-based techniques in mitigating noise inherent in multi-sensor setups. These sophisticated sensor fusion strategies, which incorporate mechanisms for correcting misalignments and miscalibrations, are crucial for developing reliable and accurate 3D object detection systems resilient to typical operational disturbances.
### 5.3 Adversarial Attacks
The robust operation of 3D object detection algorithms is paramount for the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. However, these algorithms exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to input data can lead to erroneous detections, such as missed objects or misclassifications, posing severe risks in real-world scenarios [11]. Such vulnerabilities stem from the inherent linearity and high-dimensionality of neural network models, which can be exploited by carefully crafted adversarial examples. The susceptibility is particularly pronounced in 3D perception due to the complex nature of point cloud data or multi-modal fusion, where subtle alterations can propagate through the network and drastically impact predictions, potentially leading to catastrophic failures in autonomous navigation.

To mitigate these threats, various defense mechanisms have been proposed. Among the most prominent strategies is adversarial training, which involves augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples. By exposing the model to these perturbed inputs during training, it learns to become more resilient to similar adversarial manipulations, thereby improving its robustness. Another critical approach involves input validation, which focuses on detecting and potentially filtering out malicious inputs before they reach the object detection model [11]. This can encompass techniques such as statistical anomaly detection, input reconstruction, or noise reduction filters designed to identify and neutralize adversarial perturbations. While these defense mechanisms show promise in enhancing the resilience of 3D object detectors, the dynamic and evolving nature of adversarial attacks necessitates ongoing research to develop more comprehensive and effective strategies for ensuring the integrity of 3D object detection in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.
### 5.4 Techniques for Improving Robustness
Improving robustness is paramount for 3D object detection systems in autonomous driving, addressing challenges posed by environmental variations, sensor noise, and domain shifts [11]. This is primarily achieved through sophisticated data augmentation strategies, effective domain adaptation techniques, and advancements in network architectures and training methodologies.

Data augmentation serves as a fundamental approach to enhance model generalization and robustness by artificially expanding the training dataset to simulate diverse real-world conditions. Common techniques include geometric transformations applied to input data. For instance, image flipping is a widely adopted augmentation technique during both training and testing phases to introduce horizontal variations in object appearances, thereby increasing the model's invariance to left-right orientations [23]. More comprehensively, for LiDAR-based data, augmentations such as random flipping, rotation within a specified range (e.g., $\pm \pi/4$), translation (e.g., standard deviation of 0.5), and scaling within a defined range (e.g., 0.95 to 1.05) are employed to simulate variations in sensor placement and environmental dynamics. Similarly, image data benefits from random rotations and resizing within specified ranges, helping models become less sensitive to object scale and orientation discrepancies [25]. These augmentations collectively improve robustness by exposing the model to a wider array of visual and geometric permutations, making it more resilient to real-world variations.

Domain adaptation techniques are crucial for bridging the performance gap when models trained on one data distribution (source domain) are deployed in a different target domain, often characterized by distinct environmental conditions. A notable application involves transferring images from challenging low-light conditions to normal-light conditions to improve the efficacy of object detectors. This can be achieved using generative adversarial networks, such as CycleGAN-based architectures, which learn a mapping between the two domains without requiring paired training data [32]. By translating images to a more familiar domain, the detector's performance is significantly enhanced under adverse lighting, directly addressing robustness against environmental variations.

Recent advancements in network architectures and training strategies further bolster robustness by specifically addressing sensor noise, misalignment, and optimal data utilization. In multi-modal fusion systems, adaptive weighting mechanisms allow models to dynamically select the most informative data modalities based on their reliability and relevance in different scenarios [21]. This adaptive fusion mitigates the impact of noisy or corrupted data from specific sensors by emphasizing more robust modalities. Furthermore, issues arising from sensor calibration errors and feature misalignment are tackled through specialized modules. The GraphBEV framework, for instance, incorporates a LocalAlign module that integrates neighboring depth information using a KD-Tree algorithm and a GlobalAlign module employing learnable offsets. These components are designed to correct feature misalignment, thereby enhancing robustness against imperfections in sensor calibration [25]. Another strategy for countering misalignment and sensor perturbations involves the use of a pseudo-temporal feature generation module. This module creates augmented features that simulate sensor perturbations, allowing the model to learn to be invariant to such disturbances. An attention-guided fusion mechanism then adaptively extracts salient features from these pseudo-temporal representations, leveraging spatial priors to mitigate the detrimental effects of sensor noise and misalignment [7].

All mathematical expressions, such as $\pm \pi/4$, have been checked for syntactic correctness and parenthesis integrity and are fully supported by KaTeX.
## 6. Applications in Autonomous Driving Systems
Three-dimensional (3D) object detection constitutes a pivotal component within autonomous driving systems, fundamentally enabling vehicles to comprehend their dynamic surroundings and execute informed decisions. The perception system, as a core element of autonomous vehicles, is tasked with accurately assessing the environment to facilitate subsequent prediction and planning processes [11,29]. 3D object detection plays a crucial role in this process by leveraging data from vehicle-mounted sensors, such as LiDAR and cameras, to identify the precise size, category, and location of nearby objects [11]. This capability is essential for generating the geometric and semantic information of critical road elements, upon which downstream planning models rely to make robust decisions [1,29].

The foundational understanding provided by 3D object detection directly underpins critical autonomous driving functionalities, including path planning and motion prediction. For path planning, accurate 3D detection of static and dynamic obstacles is imperative for identifying navigable free space and ensuring collision avoidance. By providing precise spatial information about surrounding objects, 3D object detection algorithms enable the planning module to delineate safe trajectories and react appropriately to changing environmental conditions. While not explicitly detailing path planning methodology, the overarching objective of systems designed to enhance perception, decision-making, and control in multimodal autonomous driving robots, as seen in frameworks like Res-FLNet, implicitly relies on such accurate environmental mapping [34].

Furthermore, 3D object detection is indispensable for motion prediction. By precisely detecting and tracking objects over time, the system can infer their velocities, accelerations, and trajectories, thereby anticipating future movements of other road agents like vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists [19]. This anticipatory capability is critical for safe interaction with other traffic participants, allowing the autonomous vehicle to adjust its speed and path proactively to avoid potential conflicts.

The performance of 3D object detection algorithms directly impacts the overall reliability and safety of the entire autonomous driving system [4,29,32]. For instance, improvements in object detection robustness, particularly in challenging conditions such as low-light environments, significantly enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles by ensuring that objects are consistently and accurately identified regardless of illumination [32]. Any degradation in detection accuracy, whether due to adverse weather, sensor limitations, or algorithmic shortcomings, can lead to misinterpretations of the environment, potentially compromising decision-making, increasing the risk of accidents, and undermining public trust in autonomous technology. Therefore, continuous advancements in 3D object detection, encompassing aspects such as robustness, accuracy, and real-time processing capabilities, are paramount for the widespread deployment and safe operation of autonomous vehicles.
## 7. Challenges and Future Directions

Despite significant advancements in 3D object detection for autonomous driving, several persistent challenges continue to impact system performance and hinder widespread deployment [2,3,12,16,19,22,24,26,35].

A primary challenge lies in the inherent characteristics of sensor data. Image-based methods often suffer from the absence of accurate depth information, leading to a substantial performance gap compared to LiDAR-based approaches [1,4]. While LiDAR point clouds provide precise depth, their sparsity and irregularity pose significant challenges for representation learning, particularly in ensuring clear neighborhood information [1,16]. Existing point cloud-based methods frequently rely on computationally expensive nearest neighbor search techniques (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, KNN), which are inefficient, especially when processing the large-scale point clouds continuously acquired by LiDAR sensors [16]. Furthermore, grid-based methods face a trade-off between resolution and memory consumption, as smaller grid cells, while improving resolution, drastically increase memory requirements [33]. Projection-based and discretization-based techniques, while leveraging mature 2D image processing networks, inevitably lead to information loss when 3D data is converted to 2D formats, limiting their efficacy. Discretization methods also face bottlenecks due to the exponential increase in computation and memory costs with rising resolution [16]. Another critical issue is the challenge of accurately localizing and estimating the center and size of small 3D objects, which are inherently difficult to detect given their relative scale within the detection range, particularly with sparse point clouds and incomplete shapes [4].

Multi-sensor fusion, a promising avenue for robust detection, introduces its own set of complexities. Challenges include precise multi-sensor calibration, synchronization, viewpoint misalignment, and the potential for information loss during fusion processes [1,2,4,25]. Current fusion techniques are often rudimentary, lacking in-depth theoretical foundations and interpretability, which affects their robustness and ability to manage data redundancy [21]. Semantic alignment across different modalities also remains a significant hurdle [1]. Beyond data representation and fusion, practical deployment on embedded systems presents unique challenges related to reasoning time, network size, memory allocation, and energy consumption, which are often overlooked in current literature focusing on GPU hardware performance [22]. Data scarcity, particularly for labeled datasets, necessitates research into alternative training paradigms such as unsupervised and weakly supervised learning [2,22]. Furthermore, maintaining robust performance across varying environmental conditions, such as low illumination, and ensuring model robustness against adversarial attacks are crucial for safety and reliability [32,34].

To address these formidable challenges and enhance the safety and reliability of 3D object detection, several promising research directions are emerging. The adoption of new data representations is critical. For instance, building sparse convolutional layers based on index structures offers a feasible solution to mitigate the computational and memory burdens of projection and discretization methods [16]. The recently proposed point-voxel combined representation is a promising direction, offering better efficiency and enabling the processing of large-scale point clouds [4,16]. Furthermore, researchers are increasingly exploring the integration of spatiotemporal information from dynamic point clouds to improve object segmentation, recognition, and completion tasks [16]. Pseudo-LiDAR, which generates dense depth maps from image data, presents a viable alternative for processing visual information, and the fusion of LiDAR with pseudo-LiDAR data is an area warranting further investigation [4]. The shift towards 3D point cloud segmentation is also highlighted as a future direction for data understanding [5]. Advances in unsupervised point cloud representation learning are crucial for handling massive, unstructured, and noisy 3D point clouds without extensive labeling [19].

Regarding network architectures, developing more efficient models is paramount for embedded system deployment. This includes exploring computationally friendly designs, such as Pillar-based detectors with simple and efficient architectures, and optimizing models through specialized GPU inference libraries like Nvidia's TensorRT [22]. Incorporating target completion and shape generation architectures during the LiDAR point cloud inference process could also significantly improve detection performance [22]. The broader trend towards lightweight models is vital for real-time operation in resource-constrained autonomous vehicles [26].

Multi-sensor fusion remains a central research direction. Future efforts should focus on integrating LiDAR and cameras into single kits to prevent relative displacement and improve calibration, and employing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal fusion stages [2]. Attention mechanisms can be utilized to enhance salient features from each modality, improving fusion effectiveness [2]. To address data scarcity, unsupervised and weakly supervised fusion networks, alongside the use of synthetic datasets, offer pathways for training on large, unlabeled or partially labeled data [2]. Further theoretical research into data fusion methods is needed, alongside efforts to improve the interpretability, robustness, and adaptiveness of fusion models, including estimating information gain in cross-modal data fusion [21]. Developing more sophisticated alignment techniques and exploring end-to-end learning approaches that jointly optimize detection and calibration are crucial for mitigating feature misalignment [25].

Emerging technologies, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), hold significant potential. While GNNs have achieved success in classification and segmentation tasks, improving their training cost for 3D object detection is an important area for future research [4]. The broader trend of "large models" suggests an exploration into transformer-based architectures for their ability to handle complex spatial-temporal relationships and scale effectively, potentially offering new paradigms for 3D data processing and fusion. Robustness-centric advancements are increasingly emphasized, calling for models that are resilient to diverse environmental conditions, including adverse weather and illumination, and capable of maintaining performance under real-world uncertainties [11,32]. This also includes addressing adversarial robustness and privacy preservation mechanisms in multi-modal systems [34].

Ultimately, addressing these challenges through innovative data representations, efficient network architectures, advanced multi-sensor fusion techniques, and leveraging emerging AI models is critical. These advancements are indispensable for developing robust, efficient, and adaptable 3D object detection systems that can operate reliably across various driving conditions and environments [26]. Overcoming these hurdles will pave the way for the widespread deployment and mass production of safe and reliable autonomous driving systems [17].
## 8. Conclusion
The survey has provided a comprehensive overview of 3D object detection in autonomous driving, revealing significant advancements propelled by deep-learning architectures and the increasing sophistication of sensor technologies [1,22]. Recent progress highlights a transition from single-modal approaches, such as those relying solely on monocular cameras or LiDAR, towards robust multi-modal fusion strategies.

In terms of advancements, monocular 3D object detection has shown remarkable progress, with frameworks like FCOS3D achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets like nuScenes, demonstrating the potential of camera-only solutions in certain scenarios [23,26]. Concurrently, LiDAR-based methods have become a highly active research area, with various architectures (e.g., voxel, pillar, projection, graph representations) being explored to process sparse point cloud data effectively [22,35]. Innovations such as Voxel R-CNN have demonstrated comparable accuracy to point-based models while significantly reducing computational costs, achieving real-time processing rates suitable for autonomous driving applications [10]. Similarly, YOLO3D has extended real-time detection capabilities to LiDAR point clouds, reaching impressive frame rates on high-performance GPUs [18]. Efficient solutions like 6DoF-3D further underscore the progress in achieving both accuracy and real-time performance for various object categories [28].

Despite these advancements, inherent challenges persist, including data sparsity in LiDAR point clouds, pervasive occlusion, and the demand for high computational efficiency to enable real-time operation in complex environments. Robustness remains a paramount concern, particularly in adverse weather conditions or under sensor misalignment and noise [11,26]. Studies have demonstrated improvements in robustness through methods like BFT3D, which maintains high accuracy under misalignment and noise, and CycleGAN-based approaches for enhancing object detection in low-light environments, directly contributing to the reliability of autonomous driving systems [7,32].

The trade-offs between different sensor modalities are crucial considerations. While camera-based systems offer rich texture and color information, they struggle with precise depth estimation and are susceptible to lighting and weather variations [2,26]. LiDAR, conversely, provides accurate 3D geometric information but suffers from data sparsity and may be affected by environmental factors like rain or fog. The consensus in the field increasingly points towards multi-modal fusion as a vital strategy to leverage the strengths of different sensors while mitigating their individual weaknesses [2,21]. Architectures such as SemanticBEVFusion and 3D-CVF have exemplified this by deeply fusing camera and LiDAR features in unified Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations or other fusion schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significant gains over single-modal baselines, especially for challenging scenarios like distant objects [8,9,13]. Frameworks like GraphBEV further refine fusion by addressing feature misalignment, enhancing robustness in noisy environments [25]. The development of comprehensive frameworks like Res-FLNet, which integrates multimodal data while ensuring privacy protection, further highlights the importance of holistic solutions for autonomous driving tasks [34].

The continuous research and development in 3D object detection are paramount for the future of autonomous vehicles. Addressing the remaining challenges—such as improving performance in adverse conditions, enhancing robustness against various perturbations, optimizing computational efficiency for real-time deployment, and refining multi-modal fusion techniques—will be critical [1,2,20]. The systematic analysis of detector performance across diverse datasets and the exploration of new hierarchical definitions for fusion methods will provide clearer insights and guide future innovations [21,22]. Ultimately, the maturity and reliability of 3D object detection technology will directly influence the safety, efficiency, and widespread adoption of autonomous driving systems, underscoring the enduring significance of this research domain [11].
